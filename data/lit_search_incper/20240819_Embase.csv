Here, we identified both potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies from a five-dose vaccinated donor who exhibited cross-reactive serum-neutralizing activity against diverse coronaviruses. Through single B-cell sorting and sequencing followed by a tailor-made computational pipeline, we successfully selected 86 antibodies with potential cross-neutralizing ability from 684 antibody sequences. Among them, PW5-570 potently neutralized all SARS-CoV-2 variants that arose prior to Omicron BA.5, and the other three could broadly neutralize all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, SARS-CoV and their related sarbecoviruses (Pangolin-GD, RaTG13, WIV-1, and SHC014). Cryo-EM analysis demonstrates that these antibodies have diverse neutralization mechanisms, such as disassembling spike trimers, or binding to RBM or SD1 to affect ACE2 binding. In addition, prophylactic administration of these antibodies significantly protects nasal turbinate and lung infections against BA.1, XBB.1, and SARS-CoV viral challenge in golden Syrian hamsters, respectively. Importantly, post-exposure treatment with PW5-5 and PW5-535 also markedly protects against XBB.1 challenge in these models. This study reveals the potential utility of computational process to assist screening cross-reactive antibodies, as well as the potency of vaccine-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies against current SARS-CoV-2 variants and related sarbecoviruses, offering promising avenues for the development of broad therapeutic antibody drugs.",,,,L2028469438,10.1038/s41421-024-00648-1
"Latent and incubation periods of Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 variant cases and associated factors: a cross-sectional study in China","Li Y., Jiang X., Qiu Y., Gao F., Xin H., Li D., Qin Y., Li Z.","BMC Infectious Diseases (2024) 24:1 Article Number: 294. Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2024","2024","24","1",,,"1 Dec 2024","Background: The latent and incubation periods characterize the transmission of infectious viruses and are the basis for the development of outbreak prevention and control strategies. However, systematic studies on the latent period and associated factors with the incubation period for SAS-CoV-2 variants are still lacking. We inferred the two durations of Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 cases and analyzed the associated factors. Methods: The Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 (and its lineages BA.2.2 and BA.2.76) cases with clear transmission chains and infectors from 10 local SAS-CoV-2 epidemics in China were enrolled. The latent and incubation periods were fitted by the Gamma distribution, and associated factors were analyzed using the accelerated failure time model. Results: The mean latent period for 672 Delta, 208 BA.1, and 677 BA.2 cases was 4.40 (95%CI: 4.24 ~ 4.63), 2.50 (95%CI: 2.27 ~ 2.76), and 2.58 (95%CI: 2.48 ~ 2.69) days, respectively, with 85.65% (95%CI: 83.40 ~ 87.77%), 97.80% (95%CI: 96.35 ~ 98.89%), and 98.87% (95%CI: 98.40 ~ 99.27%) of them starting to shed viruses within 7 days after exposure. In 405 Delta, 75 BA.1, and 345 BA.2 symptomatic cases, the mean latent period was 0.76, 1.07, and 0.79 days shorter than the mean incubation period [5.04 (95%CI: 4.83 ~ 5.33), 3.42 (95%CI: 3.00 ~ 3.89), and 3.39 (95%CI: 3.24 ~ 3.55) days], respectively. No significant difference was observed in the two durations between BA.1 and BA.2 cases. After controlling for the sex, clinical severity, vaccination history, number of infectors, the length of exposure window and shedding window, the latent period [Delta: exp(β) = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.66 ~ 0.98, p = 0.034; Omicron: exp(β) = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.71 ~ 0.94, p = 0.004] and incubation period [Delta: exp(β) = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.55 ~ 0.86, p < 0.001; Omicron: exp(β) = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.72 ~ 0.96, p = 0.013] were significantly shorter in 18 ~ 49 years but did not change significantly in ≥ 50 years compared with 0 ~ 17 years. Conclusion: Pre-symptomatic transmission can occur in Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 cases. The latent and incubation periods between BA.1 and BA.2 were similar but shorter compared with Delta.

Yet, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir failed as post-exposure prophylaxis in a trial, and frequent viral rebound has been observed in subsequent cohorts. We develop a mathematical model capturing viral-immune dynamics and nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics that recapitulates viral loads from this and another clinical trial (PLATCOV). Our results suggest that nirmatrelvir’s in vivo potency is significantly lower than in vitro assays predict. According to our model, a maximally potent agent would reduce the viral load by approximately 3.5 logs relative to placebo at 5 days. The model identifies that earlier initiation and shorter treatment duration are key predictors of post-treatment rebound. Extension of treatment to 10 days for Omicron variant infection in vaccinated individuals, rather than increasing dose or dosing frequency, is predicted to lower the incidence of viral rebound significantly.",,,38942778,L2030432296,10.1038/s41467-024-49458-9

Conventional methods of hSAR estimation are resource intensive, requiring regular contact tracing of COVID-19 cases. Our proposed framework provides a complementary method that does not rely on conventional contact tracing or laboratory involvement, including the collection, processing, and analysis of biological samples. We use a text classifier to identify reports of people tweeting about themselves and/or members of their household having COVID-19 infections. A probabilistic analysis is then performed to estimate the hSAR based on the number of self or household, and self and household tweets of COVID-19 infection. The analysis includes adjustments for a reluctance of Twitter users to tweet about household members, and the possibility that the secondary infection was not acquired within the household. Experimental results for the UK, both monthly and weekly, are reported for the period from January 2020 to February 2022. Our results agree with previously reported hSAR estimates, varying with the primary variants of concern, e.g. delta and omicron. The serial interval (SI) is based on the time between the two tweets that indicate a primary and secondary infection. Experimental results, though larger than the consensus, are qualitatively similar. The estimation of hSAR and SI using social media data constitutes a new tool that may help in characterizing, forecasting and managing outbreaks and pandemics in a faster, affordable, and more efficient manner.",,,,L2030638010,10.1038/s41746-024-01160-2
"A mathematical model of COVID-19 with multiple variants of the virus under optimal control in Ghana","Kim Y.R., Min Y., Okogun-Odompley J.N.","PLoS ONE (2024) 19:7 July Article Number: e0303791. Date of Publication: 1 Jul 2024","2024","19","7 July",,,"1 Jul 2024","In this paper, we suggest a mathematical model of COVID-19 with multiple variants of the virus under optimal control. Mathematical modeling has been used to gain deeper insights into the transmission of COVID-19, and various prevention and control strategies have been implemented to mitigate its spread. Our model is a SEIR-based model for multi-strains of COVID-19 with 7 compartments. We also consider the circulatory structure to account for the termination of immunity for COVID-19. The model is established in terms of the positivity and boundedness of the solution and the existence of equilibrium points, and the local stability of the solution. As a result of fitting data of COVID-19 in Ghana to the model, the basic reproduction number of the original virus and Delta variant was estimated to be 1.9396, and the basic reproduction number of the Omicron variant was estimated to be 3.4905, which is 1.8 times larger than that. We observe that even small differences in the incubation and recovery periods of two strains with the same initial transmission rate resulted in large differences in the number of infected individuals. In the case of COVID-19, infections caused by the Omicron variant occur 1.5 to 10 times more than those caused by the original virus. In terms of the optimal control strategy, we formulate three control strategies focusing on social distancing, vaccination, and testing-treatment. We have developed an optimal control model for the three strategies outlined above for the multi-strain model using the Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle. Through numerical simulations, we analyze three optimal control strategies for each strain and also consider combinations of the two control strategies. As a result of the simulation, all control strategies are effective in reducing disease spread, in particular, vaccination strategies are more effective than the other two control strategies. In addition the combination of the two strategies also reduces the number of infected individuals by 1/10 compared to implementing one strategy, even when mild levels are implemented. Finally, we show that if the testing-treatment strategy is not properly implemented, the number of asymptomatic and unidentified infections may surge. These results could help guide the level of government intervention and prevention strategy formulation.",,,38954691,L2033095000,10.1371/journal.pone.0303791

In the pre-BTI samples, 30% of the donors exhibited substantial immune memory against non-S (spike) SARS2 antigens, consistent with previous undiagnosed asymptomatic SARS2 infections. Following symptomatic BTI, we observed (1) enhanced S-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in donors without previous asymptomatic infection, (2) expansion of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to non-S targets (M, N, and nsps) independent of SARS2 variant, and (3) generation of novel epitopes recognizing variant-specific mutations. These variant-specific T cell responses accounted for 9%–15% of the total epitope repertoire.

With COVID-19 being declared no longer a “public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC),” the COVID pandemic is still far from over, as new Omicron subvariants of interest and concern have risen since January of 2023. Mainly with the XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 subvariants, the pandemic is still very much “alive” and “breathing.”. Methods: This review consists of five highly concerning questions about the current state of the COVID Omicron peak. We searched four main online databases to answer the first four questions. For the last one, we performed a systematic review of the literature, with keywords “Omicron,” “Guidelines,” and “Recommendations.”. Results: A total of 31 articles were included. The main symptoms of the current Omicron wave include a characteristically high fever, coughing, conjunctivitis (with itching eyes), sore throat, runny nose, congestion, fatigue, body ache, and headache. The median incubation period of the symptoms is shorter than the previous peaks. Vaccination against COVID can still be considered effective for the new subvariants. Conclusion: Guidelines recommend continuation of personal protective measures, third and fourth dose boosters, along with administration of bivalent messenger RNA vaccine boosters. The consensus antiviral treatment is combination therapy using Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir, and the consensus for pre-exposure prophylaxis is Tixagevimab and Cilgavimab combination. We hope the present paper raises awareness for the continuing presence of COVID and ways to lower the risks, especially for at-risk groups.",,,38938013,L2030407624,10.1002/iid3.1323

Date of Publication: 1 Jun 2024","2024","19","6",,,"1 Jun 2024","Our study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, spanning five waves over three years. We employed a novel Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible (SIRDS) model with a fuzzy transition between epidemic periods to estimate time-varying parameters and evaluate case underreporting. The initial basic reproduction number (R(0)) is identified at 2.44 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.42–2.46), decreasing to 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99–1.01) during the first wave. The model estimates an underreporting factor of 12.9 (95% CI: 12.5–13.2) more infections than officially reported by Brazilian health authorities, with an increasing factor of 5.8 (95% CI: 5.2–6.4), 12.9 (95% CI: 12.5–13.3), and 16.8 (95% CI: 15.8–17.5) in 2020, 2021, and 2022 respectively. Additionally, the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) is initially 0.88% (95% CI: 0.81%–0.94%) during the initial phase but consistently reduces across subsequent outbreaks, reaching its lowest value of 0.018% (95% CI: 0.011–0.033) in the last outbreak. Regarding the immunity period, the observed uncertainty and low sensitivity indicate that inferring this parameter is particularly challenging. Brazil successfully reduced R(0) during the first wave, coinciding with decreased human mobility. Ineffective public health measures during the second wave resulted in the highest mortality rates within the studied period. We attribute lower mortality rates in 2022 to increased vaccination coverage and the lower lethality of the Omicron variant. We demonstrate the model generalization by its application to other countries. Comparative analyses with serological research further validate the accuracy of the model. In forecasting analysis, our model provides reasonable outbreak predictions. In conclusion, our study provides a nuanced understanding of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, employing a novel epidemiological model.

Among additive manufacturing methods, screen printing is particularly desirable for high-throughput production of sensing platforms. However, this technique needs to be combined with carefully formulated inks, rapid postprocessing, and selective functionalization to meet all requirements for high-performance biosensing applications. Here, we present screen-printed graphene electrodes that are processed with thermal annealing to achieve high surface area and electrical conductivity for sensitive biodetection via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As a proof-of-concept, this biosensing platform is utilized for electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2. To ensure reliable specificity in the presence of multiple variants, biolayer interferometry (BLI) is used as a label-free and dynamic screening method to identify optimal antibodies for concurrent affinity to the Spike S1 proteins of Delta, Omicron, and Wild Type SARS-CoV-2 variants while maintaining low affinity to competing pathogens such as Influenza H1N1. The BLI-identified antibodies are robustly bound to the graphene electrode surface via oxygen moieties that are introduced during the thermal annealing process. The resulting electrochemical immunosensors achieve superior metrics including rapid detection (55 s readout following 15 min of incubation), low limits of detection (approaching 500 ag/mL for the Omicron variant), and high selectivity toward multiple variants. Importantly, the sensors perform well on clinical saliva samples detecting as few as 103 copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, following CDC protocols. The combination of the screen-printed graphene sensing platform and effective antibody selection using BLI can be generalized to a wide range of point-of-care immunosensors.",,,38695741,L644149242,10.1021/acsami.4c05264

These latest subvariants have been shown to be somewhat resistant to the most common vaccines even with the third dose. Moreover, it has been well documented that when patients stop taking some commercial therapies (such as Paxlovid), COVID from these variants may return and may even be more contagious. Herein, we tested unfunctionalized and functionalized selenium (Se) nanoparticles with three novel peptides (NapFFTLUFLTUTEKKKK, NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK, and NapFFSAVLQSGFKKKK) previously shown by themselves to passivate the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 BA.4, BA.5 and XBB variants. Se is a natural element in our diet and is well known to boost the immune system, thus, providing a complementary approach to viral infections. NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK showed a stronger inhibition ability at 98 % for Omicron BA.4 % and 96 % for Omicron BA.5 after just 15 min in vitro. Two types of Se nanoparticles (those made chemically or biogenically by cells) were tested to passivate the new SARS-CoV-2 XBB variant. Results showed that the combination of any peptide and using either type of Se NP, the Omicron subvariant XBB was inhibited by 100 % after just 15 min in vitro. Interestingly, the use of Se NPs alone outperformed the peptides in terms of XBB passivation. Also, in order to determine a mechanism of action, functionalizing Se nanoparticles with the NapFFSAVLQSGFKKKK peptide showed a high binding ability toward the chemotrypsin-like cysteine protease (SARS CoV-2 3CLpro). Further, as a demonstration of their versatility, these functionalized peptides also passivated the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). NapFFTLUFLTUTEKKKK and NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK showed in silico interactions with the fusion glycoprotein of RSV prompting in vitro RSV pseudo virus testing. Compared to the conventionally precipitated synthetic Se nanoparticles, in vitro results showed that biogenic Se functionalized with the peptides enhanced the inhibition RSV to 100 % after just 15 min of incubation.

For Germany and Italy, staggered difference-in-differences analysis was employed to explore the causal relationship between school reopening and R(c) changes, accounting for varying reopening dates. In Portugal, interrupted time series analysis was used due to simultaneous school reopenings. Multivariable models were adopted to adjust for confounders. Results: In Italy and Germany, post-reopening R(c) estimates were significantly lower compared to those from regions/states that had not yet reopened at the same time points, both in the student population (overall average treatment effect for the treated subpopulation [O-ATT]: -0.80 [95% CI: -0.94;-0.66] for Italy; O-ATT-0.30 [95% CI: -0.36;-0.23] for Germany) and the adult population (O-ATT: -0.04 [95% CI: -0.07;-0.01] for Italy; O-ATT: -0.07 [95% CI: -0.11;-0.03] for Germany).

The use of antibiotics has greatly increased during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic owing to the presence of bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infections. The antibiotics daptomycin (DAP) is widely used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria owing to its highly efficient antibacterial activity. It is pivotal to study the antibiotics usage options for patients of coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) with pneumonia those need admission to receive antibiotics treatment for bacterial co-infection in managing COVID-19 disease. Herein, we have revealed the interactions of DAP with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the variant Omicron (B1.1.529) using the molecular docking approach and Omicron (B1.1.529) pseudovirus (PsV) mimic invasion. Molecular docking analysis shows that DAP has a certain degree of binding ability to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and several derived virus variants, and co-incubation of 1–100 μM DAP with cells promotes the entry of the PsV into human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-expressing HEK-293T cells (HEK-293T-hACE2), and this effect is related to the concentration of extracellular calcium ions (Ca(2+)). The PsV invasion rate in the HEK-293T-hACE2 cells concurrently with DAP incubation was 1.7 times of PsV infection alone. In general, our findings demonstrate that DAP promotes the infection of PsV into cells, which provides certain reference of antibiotics selection and usage optimization for clinicians to treat bacterial coinfection or secondary infection during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",,,38576396,L2029559761,10.1080/21505594.2024.2339703

However, both pathogen biology and changing host characteristics-such as varying levels of immunity-can combine to influence replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within and between hosts. Disentangling the role of variant and host in individual-level viral shedding of VOCs is essential to inform Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) planning and response and interpret past epidemic trends. Using data from a prospective observational cohort study of healthy adult volunteers undergoing weekly occupational health PCR screening, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct individual-level viral kinetics and estimate how different factors shaped viral dynamics, measured by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values over time. Jointly accounting for both interindividual variation in Ct values and complex host characteristics-such as vaccination status, exposure history, and age-we found that age and number of prior exposures had a strong influence on peak viral replication. Older individuals and those who had at least 5 prior antigen exposures to vaccination and/or infection typically had much lower levels of shedding. Moreover, we found evidence of a correlation between the speed of early shedding and duration of incubation period when comparing different VOCs and age groups. Our findings illustrate the value of linking information on participant characteristics, symptom profile and infecting variant with prospective PCR sampling, and the importance of accounting for increasingly complex population exposure landscapes when analysing the viral kinetics of VOCs.","ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04750356)",,38289907,L2030118530,10.1371/journal.pbio.3002463

Methods: This cohort study retrospectively reviewed 71 SARS-CoV-2-infected children with IEI using nationwide data from the National Center for Children’s Health of China. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive rapid antigen or nucleic acid test result. Results: Among 71 SARS-CoV-2-infected children with IEI, male preponderance (male: female ratio of ~1.8:1), a median age of 8 years (IQR 3–11), and a predominance of antibody deficiency (19/71, 26.8%) were detected. Most of the patients got infected through household transmission, while a small proportion of them did so during hospital visits. The mean time periods were 3.3 days (n=44) for incubation, 8.4 days for symptoms (n=69), and 8.8 days for viral shedding (n=37). The time to viral shedding was proportional to the symptomatic period (R(2 =) 0.1243, p=0.0323) and prolonged in children with X- linked agammaglobulinemia. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, and some children showed only aggravation of the underlying disease. 15% of IEI children progress to pneumonia, 85% require medication, 17% are admitted to hospital, and 4.1% are classified as critical. Previously application of anti- infective medications was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization after COVID-19 infection. Of the 71 children with IEI, all recovered from COVID- 19. Conclusion: Overall, Omicron variant did not cause significant life-threatening infections among children with IEI in China, and most of them had a good clinical outcome.

As Omicron is prompted to replicate in the upper airway, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) delivered through inhalation might inhibit early-stage infection in the respiratory tract. Thus, elucidating the prophylactic efficacy of NAbs via nasal spray addresses an important clinical need. METHODS. The applicable potential of a nasal spray cocktail containing 2 NAbs was characterized by testing its neutralizing potency, synergetic neutralizing mechanism, emergency protective and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) in human nasal cavity. RESULTS. The 2 NAbs displayed broad neutralizing efficacy against Omicron, and they could structurally compensate each other in blocking the Spike-ACE2 interaction. When administrated through the intranasal mucosal route, this cocktail demonstrated profound efficacy in the emergency prevention in hamsters challenged with authentic Omicron BA.1. The investigator-initiated trial in healthy volunteers confirmed the safety and the PK/PD of the NAb cocktail delivered via nasal spray. Nasal samples from the participants receiving 4 administrations over a course of 16 hours demonstrated potent neutralization against Omicron BA.5 in an ex vivo pseudovirus neutralization assay. CONCLUSION. These results demonstrate that the NAb cocktail nasal spray provides a good basis for clinical prophylactic efficacy against Omicron infections.",,,38587080,L2031512229,10.1172/jci.insight.171034

Among all known SARS-CoV-2 genovariants, within the last about two years Omicron remains dominant. The distinctive properties of this genovariant are presented by short incubation period (1–5 days), high contagiousness, and a relatively mild disease course due to largest number of genomic mutations among all SARS-CoV-2 genovariants. The first case of Omicron genovariant-caused infection in Russia was recorded in early December 2021. Over many month-monitoring after active spread of the genovariant in Russia, it is obvious that in a number of key characteristics it differs profoundly from previous SARS-CoV-2 genovariants. Analyzing major patterns inherent in COVID-19 epidemic process particularly uncovering geographic features is one of the most crucial activities in COVID-19 surveillance. Here, we provide a comparatively analyzed pattern of Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 genovariant dominated COVID-19 incidence in the population of the Saratov region. For this, there was used statistical reporting from the Office of Rospotrebnadzor for the Saratov Region. The main research method is based on epidemiological analysis. The study data showed that upon Omicron genovariant dominance, an increased percentage in COVID-19 cases among children of varying age, increased rate of infected subjects with unknown source of infection as well as improved clinical disease course were recorded. Regardless of the circulating genovariant, elderly people remain to be in risk group. Thus, after three years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mutual adaptation for SARSCoV-2 and human population can be observed, which is accompanied by altered biological properties of the former and the accumulation of herd immunity. Alleviated disease symptoms and decreased mortality rate among Omicron genovariant-infected individuals evidence in favor of further COVID-19 transformation into a seasonal infection.",,,,L2032244569,10.15789/2220-7619-CAP-17555

Methods: In this study, data were collected on indigenous aggregated outbreaks in Nanjing from January 2020 to December 2022, caused by five strains including the original strain, the Delta variant, and the Omicron variant (BA.2, BA.5.2, and BF.7). The basic epidemiological characteristics of infected individuals were described and then parametric analysis of transmission dynamics was performed, including the calculation of incubation period, serial interval (SI), the basic reproductive number (R0), and the household secondary attack rate (HSAR). Finally, we compared the trends of transmission dynamic parameters of different strains. Results: The incubation period for the original strain, the Delta variant, Omicron BA.2, Omicron BA.5.2, and Omicron BF.7 were 6 d (95% CI: 3.5-7.5 d), 5 d (95% CI: 4.0-6.0 d), 3 d (95% CI: 3.0-4.0 d), 3 d (95% CI: 3.0-3.0 d), and 2 d (95% CI: 2.0-3.0 d), respectively; Also, the SI of the five strains were 5.69 d, 4.79 d, 2.7 d, 2.12 d, and 2.43 d, respectively.

Most vaccines are designed against the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein because antibodies directed toward this protein can neutralize the infection. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are directed against the Spike RBD domain, the part of the antigen that interacts with the ACE2 host cell receptor. Although the emergency phase of COVID-19 is over, the virus continues to spread and evolve, constituting a threat, especially to particular high-risk groups like elderly persons, adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women and frontline health workers. Detection of serum neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) is a key measure of human immunity, and, thus, a critical parameter to evaluate vaccination efficacy and the extent of protection provided to individuals. Gold standard methods for nAbs determinations generally rely on neutralization tests with live virus or pseudovirus particles; nonetheless, these methods are expensive, time-consuming, and not highly processive. To overcome such disadvantages, we here present the development and validation of a surrogate neutralization ELISA assay for SARS-CoV-2 nAbs detection and quantification in sera samples of infected or vaccinated individuals. The assay is based on the competitive binding of serum neutralizing antibodies to the solid-phase immobilized viral RBD domain in the presence of its cognate receptor, ACE2. The ELISA development involved the production of the recombinant RBD and ACE2 proteins in mammalian cells, ACE2 labeling, and the setup of several assay parameters, such as incubation times, reagent concentrations, and controls selection. In addition, the surrogate neutralization ELISA performance was validated against a viral neutralization test with live SARS-CoV-2 particles, exhibiting comparable specificity and sensitivity values. Overall, our surrogate ELISA SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test, the first of its kind developed in our country, constitutes a rapid and cost-effective tool for evaluating national herd immunity and supporting public health decision-making on high-priority groups vaccination. Future assay validations against circulating omicron RBD variants are underway.",,,,L644259738,

Date of Publication: 20 Dec 2023","2023","151",,,,"20 Dec 2023","New SARS-CoV-2 variants causing COVID-19 are a major risk to public health worldwide due to the potential for phenotypic change and increases in pathogenicity, transmissibility and/or vaccine escape. Recognising signatures of new variants in terms of replacing growth and severity are key to informing the public health response. To assess this, we aimed to investigate key time periods in the course of infection, hospitalisation and death, by variant. We linked datasets on contact tracing (Contact Tracing Advisory Service), testing (the Second-Generation Surveillance System) and hospitalisation (the Admitted Patient Care dataset) for the entire length of contact tracing in the England - from March 2020 to March 2022. We modelled, for England, time delay distributions using a Bayesian doubly interval censored modelling approach for the SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Delta, Delta Plus (AY.4.2), Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2. This was conducted for the incubation period, the time from infection to hospitalisation and hospitalisation to death. We further modelled the growth of novel variant replacement using a generalised additive model with a negative binomial error structure and the relationship between incubation period length and the risk of a fatality using a Bernoulli generalised linear model with a logit link. The mean incubation periods for each variant were: Alpha 4.19 (95% credible interval (CrI) 4.13-4.26) days; Delta 3.87 (95% CrI 3.82-3.93) days; Delta Plus 3.92 (95% CrI 3.87-3.98) days; Omicron BA.1 3.67 (95% CrI 3.61-3.72) days and Omicron BA.2 3.48 (95% CrI 3.43-3.53) days.

The mean time from hospitalisation to death was, for Alpha 14.31 (95% CrI 14.00-14.62) days; Delta 12.81 (95% CrI 12.62-13.00) days and Omicron BA.2 16.02 (95% CrI 15.46-16.60) days. The 95th percentile of the incubation periods were: Alpha 11.19 (95% CrI 10.92-11.48) days; Delta 9.97 (95% CrI 9.73-10.21) days; Delta Plus 9.99 (95% CrI 9.78-10.24) days; Omicron BA.1 9.45 (95% CrI 9.23-9.67) days and Omicron BA.2 8.83 (95% CrI 8.62-9.05) days. Shorter incubation periods were associated with greater fatality risk when adjusted for age, sex, variant, vaccination status, vaccination manufacturer and time since last dose with an odds ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.83) (P value < 0.05). Variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have replaced previously dominant variants have had shorter incubation periods. Conversely co-existing variants have had very similar and non-distinct incubation period distributions. Shorter incubation periods reflect generation time advantage, with a reduction in the time to the peak infectious period, and may be a significant factor in novel variant replacing growth. Shorter times for admission to hospital and death were associated with variant severity - the most severe variant, Delta, led to significantly earlier hospitalisation, and death. These measures are likely important for future risk assessment of new variants, and their potential impact on population health.",,,36535802,L2021938552,10.1017/S0950268822001935

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023","2023","23","1",,,"1 Dec 2023","Background: The serial interval is the period of time between symptom onset in the primary case and symptom onset in the secondary case. Understanding the serial interval is important for determining transmission dynamics of infectious diseases like COVID-19, including the reproduction number and secondary attack rates, which could influence control measures. Early meta-analyses of COVID-19 reported serial intervals of 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.9–5.5) for the original wild-type variant and 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.87–5.47) for Alpha variant. The serial interval has been shown to decrease over the course of an epidemic for other respiratory diseases, which may be due to accumulating viral mutations and implementation of more effective nonpharmaceutical interventions. We therefore aggregated the literature to estimate serial intervals for Delta and Omicron variants. Methods: This study followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. A systematic literature search was conducted of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and preprint server medRxiv for articles published from April 4, 2021, through May 23, 2023. Search terms were: (“serial interval” or “generation time”), (“Omicron” or “Delta”), and (“SARS-CoV-2” or “COVID-19”). Meta-analyses were done for Delta and Omicron variants using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator model with a random effect for each study. Pooled average estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are reported. Results: There were 46,648 primary/secondary case pairs included for the meta-analysis of Delta and 18,324 for Omicron. Mean serial interval for included studies ranged from 2.3–5.8 days for Delta and 2.1–4.8 days for Omicron. The pooled mean serial interval for Delta was 3.9 days (95% CI: 3.4–4.3) (20 studies) and Omicron was 3.2 days (95% CI: 2.9–3.5) (20 studies). Mean estimated serial interval for BA.1 was 3.3 days (95% CI: 2.8–3.7) (11 studies), BA.2 was 2.9 days (95% CI: 2.7–3.1) (six studies), and BA.5 was 2.3 days (95% CI: 1.6–3.1) (three studies). Conclusions: Serial interval estimates for Delta and Omicron were shorter than ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variants. More recent Omicron subvariants had even shorter serial intervals suggesting serial intervals may be shortening over time. This suggests more rapid transmission from one generation of cases to the next, consistent with the observed faster growth dynamic of these variants compared to their ancestors.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2023","2023","21","1",,,"1 Dec 2023","Background: After the first COVID-19 wave caused by the ancestral lineage, the pandemic has been fueled from the continuous emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Understanding key time-to-event periods for each emerging variant of concern is critical as it can provide insights into the future trajectory of the virus and help inform outbreak preparedness and response planning. Here, we aim to examine how the incubation period, serial interval, and generation time have changed from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 lineage to different variants of concern. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that synthesized the estimates of incubation period, serial interval, and generation time (both realized and intrinsic) for the ancestral lineage, Alpha, Beta, and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. Results: Our study included 280 records obtained from 147 household studies, contact tracing studies, or studies where epidemiological links were known. With each emerging variant, we found a progressive shortening of each of the analyzed key time-to-event periods, although we did not find statistically significant differences between the Omicron subvariants. We found that Omicron BA.1 had the shortest pooled estimates for the incubation period (3.49 days, 95% CI: 3.13–4.86 days), Omicron BA.5 for the serial interval (2.37 days, 95% CI: 1.71–3.04 days), and Omicron BA.1 for the realized generation time (2.99 days, 95% CI: 2.48–3.49 days). Only one estimate for the intrinsic generation time was available for Omicron subvariants: 6.84 days (95% CrI: 5.72–8.60 days) for Omicron BA.1. The ancestral lineage had the highest pooled estimates for each investigated key time-to-event period. We also observed shorter pooled estimates for the serial interval compared to the incubation period across the virus lineages. When pooling the estimates across different virus lineages, we found considerable heterogeneities (I (2) > 80%; I (2) refers to the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance), possibly resulting from heterogeneities between the different study populations (e.g., deployed interventions, social behavior, demographic characteristics). Conclusions: Our study supports the importance of conducting contact tracing and epidemiological investigations to monitor changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. Our findings highlight a progressive shortening of the incubation period, serial interval, and generation time, which can lead to epidemics that spread faster, with larger peak incidence, and harder to control. We also consistently found a shorter serial interval than incubation period, suggesting that a key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is the potential for pre-symptomatic transmission. These observations are instrumental to plan for future COVID-19 waves.",,,37775772,L2025795757,10.1186/s12916-023-03070-8

VOC mutations largely occur in the S1 subunit of Spike. The S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is conserved and thus more likely to elicit broadly reactive immune responses that could improve protection. However, the contribution of the S2 subunit in improving the overall efficacy of vaccines remains unclear. Therefore, we designed, and evaluated the immunogenicity and protective potential of a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) fused to a stabilized S2. Immunogens were expressed as soluble proteins with approximately fivefold higher purified yield than the Spike ectodomain and formulated along with Squalene-in-water emulsion (SWE) adjuvant. Immunization with S2 alone failed to elicit a neutralizing immune response, but significantly reduced lung viral titers in mice challenged with the heterologous Beta variant. In hamsters, SWE-formulated RS2 (a genetic fusion of stabilized RBD with S2) showed enhanced immunogenicity and efficacy relative to corresponding RBD and Spike formulations. Despite being based on the ancestral Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2, RS2 elicited broad neutralization, including against Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.5 and BF.7), and the clade 1a WIV-1 and SARS-CoV-1 strains. RS2 elicited sera showed enhanced competition with both S2 directed and RBD Class 4 directed broadly neutralizing antibodies, relative to RBD and Spike elicited sera. When lyophilized, RS2 retained antigenicity and immunogenicity even after incubation at 37 °C for a month. The data collectively suggest that the RS2 immunogen is a promising modality to combat SARS-CoV-2 variants.",,,,L2026269167,10.1038/s41541-023-00755-2

Even if it was only 20% of people isolated at home after antigen testing, the peak of the epidemic could be reduced by 9.46%.

Antigen testing performed better effects in school (reduction proportion 29.27%) and community (29.34%) than in workplace (27.75%).

Increased breakthrough infections among nursing home residents (NHR) are clinically consequential despite good vaccine coverage and substantial antibody titers. While vaccination blunted severe outcomes, breakthrough infections may arise from lower vaccine-induced antibody quality. We aimed to assess vaccine-induced antibody quality among NHR and younger healthcare workers (HCW) using antibody avidity. Methods. We longitudinally sampled 50 NHR and 30 HCWs, with or without prior history of COVID-19, who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at 0-14 days before, 2 weeks, and 4-6 months after each vaccine dose up to the bivalent (BV) boosters. Primary outcomes included anti-spike, anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), and avidity levels to the ancestral Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 strains determined by bead-multiplex immunoassay and ability to bind after 6M urea vs. saline incubation. Results. After the primary series, anti-spike and RBD titers increased significantly to all 3 strains in both NHR and HCW. Avidity levels progressively increased across all time points up to the 3rd dose. Interestingly, this increase continued 6-8 months after vaccination suggesting that affinity maturation continues to occur for many months after the primary vaccination series. NHRs without prior infection have the poorest avidity levels to Delta and Omicron, especially before the 3rd dose. The 3rd dose raised avidity levels substantially in all groups and for all strains. Avidity levels after boosting, across the 3rd and 4th doses, demonstrate evidence of durability. Preliminary findings after BV boost show a continuation of avidity maturation with a larger impact on prior infected individuals.

The booster dose increases avidity, adding to vaccine-induced antibody functional ability. Higher avidity antibodies have higher cross-reactivity to other SARS-CoV-2 strains, as Wuhan boosting improves Delta and Omicron avidity, and should improve protection from ever-evolving strains.

Date of Publication: 28 Nov 2023","2023","142",,"5405",,"28 Nov 2023","Introduction: An exaggerated inflammatory response both locally and systemically mediated by innate immune signaling is a near universal feature of severe COVID-19 illness and has been associated with multi-organ damage and thrombosis. As part of an antiviral response, activation and formation of the intracellular NLRP3 inflammasome leads to expression of proinflammatory IL-1 family cytokines. In macrophages, the NLRP3 inflammasome is linked to the release of tissue factor (TF) bearing microvesicles. Multiple studies provide evidence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in COVID-19 including increased IL-1β in monocytes, sera, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from COVID-19 patients. Patient monocytes bear features of inflammasome activation, which correlate with disease severity (Potere et al. Cardiovascular Research 2023). Given the central role of thromboinflammation in COVID-19, we explored the ability of various coronavirus spike proteins to increase TF activity in a monocytic cell line. Mechanistically, we sought to explore the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggered tissue factor generation. Methods: The SARS-CoV-2 α variant S1 subunit (S1α) and Omicron variant BA.1.1.529 S1 (S1O) recombinant proteins were obtained from Raybiotech and OC43, a non-COVID respiratory human coronavirus, recombinant spike protein (OC43 S) from Sino Biological. THP-1 cells at a concentration of 2x10 (6)/mL were incubated with spike proteins at 37°C in RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor (MCC950) was incubated with select samples for 1 hour following addition of the spike protein. The cells were harvested, subjected to RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription. TF, NLRP3, caspase (CASP)-1, and IL-1β relative mRNA expression was quantified using RT-PCR and normalized to GADPH expression. For quantifying microparticle TF activity, cells were incubated with the spike proteins for 6 hours then microparticles were isolated from the supernatant after centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 minutes at 4°C, washed and TF activity was measured using a two-stage chromogenic assay kit (Abcam). A monoclonal anti-TF antibody (Santa Cruz) was used to confirm specificity for TF generation. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Data is presented as mean ± standard deviation. The student t test was used to assess the difference between unpaired groups with a value of p <.05 considered statistically significant. Results: Our previous data showed that S1α, but not S1O or OC43 S, leads to increased TF mRNA expression in THP-1 cells in a dose dependent manner. Here we show TF microparticle activity was increased with S1α (20 µg/mL) as compared to incubation of THP-1 cells with S1O or OC43 spike proteins (20 µg/mL), which were comparable to the activity of cells alone ( Figure 1). After treatment with S1α (20 µg/mL) for 1 hour, we found increased expression of TF (10-fold), NLRP3 (2-fold), CASP-1 (3-fold), and IL-1β (3.5-fold). Treatment with S1O and OC43 S did not lead to a significant change in relative mRNA expression of TF, NLRP3, CASP-1, and IL-1β. Following incubation with the S1α spike protein for 1 hour, cells were re-plated in fresh media containing 10 µM MCC950. Treatment with MCC950 significantly reduced expression of TF, NLRP3, CASP-1, and IL-1β ( Figure 2). Conclusion: We confirmed that TF expression induced by the S1α spike protein leads to an increase in TF activity, as assessed by microparticle generation. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a mediator of coagulopathy induced by the spike protein, and TF, CASP-1, and IL-1β expression are abrogated after specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. TF activity and inflammation induced by the coronavirus spike proteins in vitro correlates with the respective clinical phenotype and disease severity of the variants. This suggests that the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on TF and inflammasome activation derive in part from the spike protein, and these assays may be useful in predicting the effects of spike protein variants.",,,,L2028766598,10.1182/blood-2023-187738

The most potent inhibitor 2f (81) was found to efficiently inhibit the replication of various SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants in VeroE6 and Calu-3 cells, with EC(50) range of 0.001–0.026 μM by pre-incubation with the virus to avoid the virus entry. The more potent antiviral activities than the proteases inhibitory activities led to discovery that the synthesized compounds also inhibited Spike's receptor binding domain (RBD):angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction as a main target, and their antiviral activities were enhanced by inhibiting TMPRSS2 and/or Furin. To further confirm the blocking effect of 2f (81) on virus entry, SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudovirus was used in the entry assay and the results showed that the compound inhibited the pseudovirus entry in a ACE2-dependent pathway, via mainly inhibiting RBD:ACE2 interaction and TMPRSS2 activity in Calu-3 cells.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted among primary close contacts without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection identified in Shenzhen, China, between February and October 2022. Multiple strict nucleic acid testing and symptom surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection were regularly conducted during the 7-day centralized plus 7-day home-based quarantine. Exposure: A booster with an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine vs no booster after receipt of the primary 2-dose inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were overall, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections. Secondary outcomes were length of incubation and level of cycle threshold values. All the outcomes were assessed during the quarantine period. Results: Among 119438 eligible participants (mean [SD] age, 37.6 [12.0] years; 66201 men [55.4%]), 86251 (72.2%) received a booster dose of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 33187 (27.8%) did not. A total of 671 cases infected with Omicron BA.2 were confirmed (464 symptomatic and 207 asymptomatic), and no severe infection or death events were observed. At a median (IQR) duration of 111 (75 to 134) days after booster vaccination, the relative effectiveness of a booster was 32.2% (95% CI, 11.3% to 48.2%) for overall infection, 23.8% (95% CI, -8.2% to 46.4%) for symptomatic infection, and 43.3% (95% CI, 12.3% to 63.3%) for asymptomatic infection. The effectiveness against overall infection changed nonlinearly over time following booster vaccination: 44.9% (95% CI, 4.9% to 68.1%) within 60 days, 50.4% (95% CI, 23.7% to 67.7%) at 61 to 120 days, 29.1% (95% CI, -4.8% to 52.1%) at 121 to 180 days, and 19.4% (95% CI, -14.4% to 43.2%) after 180 days (nonlinear P =.03).

Compared to population-level models previously used to estimate outbreak risks, our approach enables more detailed analysis of how the risk can be mitigated through pre-emptive interventions such as antigen testing. Considering SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we quantify the within-host dynamics using data from individuals with omicron variant infections. We demonstrate that regular antigen testing reduces, but may not eliminate, the outbreak risk, depending on characteristics of local transmission. In our baseline analysis, daily antigen testing reduces the outbreak risk by 45% compared to a scenario without antigen testing. Additionally, we show that accounting for heterogeneity in within-host dynamics between individuals affects outbreak risk estimates and assessments of the impact of antigen testing.

Date of Publication: 1 Sep 2023","2023","44",,,,"1 Sep 2023","Background: The serial interval is a key epidemiological measure that quantifies the time between the onset of symptoms in an infector-infectee pair. It indicates how quickly new generations of cases appear, thus informing on the speed of an epidemic. Estimating the serial interval requires to identify pairs of infectors and infectees. Yet, most studies fail to assess the direction of transmission between cases and assume that the order of infections - and thus transmissions - strictly follows the order of symptom onsets, thereby imposing serial intervals to be positive. Because of the long and highly variable incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, this may not always be true (i.e an infectee may show symptoms before their infector) and negative serial intervals may occur. This study aims to estimate the serial interval of different SARS-CoV-2 variants whilst accounting for negative serial intervals. Methods: This analysis included 5 842 symptomatic individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst 2 579 households from September 2020 to August 2022 across England & Wales. We used a Bayesian framework to infer who infected whom by exploring all transmission trees compatible with the observed dates of symptoms, based on a wide range of incubation period and generation time distributions compatible with estimates reported in the literature. Serial intervals were derived from the reconstructed transmission pairs, stratified by variants. Results: We estimated that 22% (95% credible interval (CrI) 8–32%) of serial interval values are negative across all VOC. The mean serial interval was shortest for Omicron BA5 (2.02 days, 1.26–2.84) and longest for Alpha (3.37 days, 2.52–4.04). Conclusions: This study highlights the large proportion of negative serial intervals across SARS-CoV-2 variants. Because the serial interval is widely used to estimate transmissibility and forecast cases, these results may have critical implications for epidemic control.",,,37579586,L2026379947,10.1016/j.epidem.2023.100713

However, the mechanisms by which ABO(H) antigens influence susceptibility to COVID-19 remain incompletely understood. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates host cell engagement, bears significant similarity to galectins, an ancient family of carbohydrate-binding proteins. Because ABO(H) blood group antigens are carbohydrates, we compared the glycan-binding specificity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with that of galectins. Similar to the binding profile of several galectins, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2, including Delta and Omicron variants, exhibited specificity for blood group A. Not only did each RBD recognize blood group A in a glycan array format, but each SARS-CoV-2 virus also displayed a preferential ability to infect blood group A–expressing cells. Preincubation of blood group A cells with a blood group-binding galectin specifically inhibited the blood group A enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas similar incubation with a galectin that does not recognize blood group antigens failed to impact SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can engage blood group A, providing a direct link between ABO(H) blood group expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection.",,,37367252,L2026170766,10.1182/blood.2022018903

Here, we identified both potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies from a five-dose vaccinated donor who exhibited cross-reactive serum neutralizing activity against diverse coronaviruses. Through single B cell sorting and sequencing followed by a tailor-made computational pipeline, we successfully selected 86 antibodies with potential cross-neutralizing ability from 684 antibody sequences. Among them, one potently neutralized all SARS-CoV-2 variants that arose prior to Omicron BA.5, and the other three could broadly neutralize all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, SARS-CoV and their related sarbecoviruses (Pangolin-GD, RaTG13, WIV-1, and SHC014). Cryo-EM analysis demonstrates that these antibodies have diverse neutralization mechanisms, such as disassembling spike trimers, or binding to RBM or SD1 to affect ACE2 binding. In addition, prophylactic administration of these antibodies significantly protects nasal turbinate and lung infections against BA.1, XBB.1 and SARS-CoV viral challenge in golden Syrian hamsters, respectively.

Date of Publication: 24 Jul 2023","2023",,,,,"24 Jul 2023","Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seen several variants of concern, including the Omicron (BA.1) variant which emerged in October 2021. Accurately estimating the incubation period of these variants is crucial for predicting disease spread and formulating effective public health strategies. However, existing estimates often conflict because of biases arising from the dynamic nature of epidemic growth and selective inclusion of cases. This study aims to accurately estimate of the Omicron (BA.1) variant incubation period based on data from Taiwan, where disease incidence remained low and contact tracing was comprehensive during the first months of the Omicron outbreak. Methods: We reviewed 100 contact-tracing records for cases of the Omicron BA.1 variant reported between December 2021 and January 2022, and found enough information to analyze 70 of these. The incubation period distribution was estimated by fitting data on exposure and symptom onset within a Bayesian mixture model using gamma, Weibull, and lognormal distributions as candidates. Additionally, a systematic literature search was conducted to accumulate data for estimates of the incubation period for Omicron (BA.1/2, BA.4/5) subvariants, which was then used for meta-analysis and comparison. Results: The mean incubation period was estimated at 3.5 days (95% credible interval: 3.1–4.0 days), with no clear differences when stratified by vaccination status or age. This estimate aligns closely with the pooled mean of 3.4 days (3.0–3.8 days) obtained from a meta-analysis of other published studies on Omicron subvariants. Conclusions: The relatively shorter incubation period of the Omicron variant, as compared to previous SARS-CoV2 variants, implies its potential for rapid spread but also opens the possibility for individuals to voluntarily adopt shorter, more resource-efficient quarantine periods. Continual updates to incubation period estimates, utilizing data from comprehensive contact tracing, are crucial for effectively guiding these voluntary actions and adjusting high socio-economic cost interventions.",,,,L2026215388,10.1101/2023.07.20.23292983

Here we present a method, suitable for this task, which uses as unique information the daily number of reported cases. The method is based on a time since infection model where transmission parameters are obtained by means of an efficient maximization procedure of the likelihood. Applying the method to SARS-CoV-2 data in Italy, we find an average generation time [Formula: see text] days, during the temporal window when the majority of infections can be attributed to the Omicron variants. At the same time we find a significantly larger value [Formula: see text] days, in the temporal window when spreading was dominated by the Delta variant. We are also able to show that the presence of the Omicron variant, characterized by a shorter [Formula: see text], was already detectable in the first weeks of December 2021, in full agreement with results provided by sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported in national databases. Our results therefore show that the novel approach can indicate the existence of virus variants, resulting particularly useful in situations when information about genomic sequencing is not yet available.

In this system, a single-step reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification-CRISPR/Cas13a assay was incorporated with optimized extraction-free viral lysis and reagent lyophilization, which could eliminate complicated sample processing steps and rigorous reagent storage conditions. Remarkably, 10% glycine as a chemical additive could improve the assay sensitivity by 10 times, making the limit of detection as low as 1 copy/μL (5 copies/reaction). A compact optic fiber-integrated smartphone-based device was developed for sample lysis, assay incubation, fluorescence imaging, and result interpretation.

The Omicron subvariants were significantly less recognized and neutralized by antibodies from vaccinated individuals. This resulted in a surge in the number of infections, and booster shots were recommended to improve responses against these variants. While most studies mainly measured the neutralizing activity against variants, we and others previously reported that Fc-effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), play an important role in humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed Spike recognition and ADCC activity against several Omicron subvariants by generating cell lines expressing different Omicron subvariant Spikes. We tested these responses in a cohort of donors, who were recently infected or not, before and after a fourth dose of mRNA vaccine. We showed that ADCC activity is less affected than neutralization by the antigenic shift of the tested Omicron subvariant Spikes.

VOCs were categorized as Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2). Omicron (B.1.1.529) was a further modified strain that has a short incubation period; it was called VOC by the WHO, and it became fifth on the list of variants. Omicron has spread faster than any other variant since its emergence in late 2021. Omicron is currently the only circulating VOC. The various subvariants of Omicron are BA.1 (B.1.1.529.1), BA.2 (B.1.1.529.2), BA.3 (B.1.1.529.3), BA.4, BA.5, and descendent lineages. More recently, identified Omicron subvariants and sublineages BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BA.4.6, BF.7, BA.2.75.2, XBB.1, and BF.7 have also attracted global attention. The BA.5 strain of Omicron is the most contagious and dominant subvariant globally. Recent spikes in cases in China are due to the BF.7 subvariant.

To address the challenge of constrained resource optimization for managing diseases with complications like pre- and asymptomatic transmission, we develop an integro partial differential equation compartmental disease model which incorporates realistic latent, incubation, and infectious period distributions along with limited testing supplies for identifying and quarantining infected individuals. Our model overcomes the limitations of typical ordinary differential equation compartmental models by decoupling symptom status from model compartments to allow a more realistic representation of symptom onset and presymptomatic transmission. To analyze the influence of these realistic features on disease controllability, we find optimal strategies for reducing total infection sizes that allocate limited testing resources between ‘clinical’ testing, which targets symptomatic individuals, and ‘non-clinical’ testing, which targets non-symptomatic individuals. We apply our model not only to the original, delta, and omicron COVID-19 variants, but also to generically parameterized disease systems with varying mismatches between latent and incubation period distributions, which permit varying degrees of presymptomatic transmission or symptom onset before infectiousness. We find that factors that decrease controllability generally call for reduced levels of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies, while the relationship between incubation-latent mismatch, controllability, and optimal strategies is complicated. In particular, though greater degrees of presymptomatic transmission reduce disease controllability, they may increase or decrease the role of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies depending on other disease factors like transmissibility and latent period length. Importantly, our model allows a spectrum of diseases to be compared within a consistent framework such that lessons learned from COVID-19 can be transferred to resource constrained scenarios in future emerging epidemics and analyzed for optimality.",,,,L2024766957,10.1016/j.idm.2023.04.007

We explored the potential for biofilms to act as a reservoir in protecting, harboring, and dispersing SARS-CoV-2 throughout the meat processing facility environment. To do this, we used Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, and meat processing facility drain samples to develop mixed-species biofilms on materials found in meat processing facilities (stainless steel (SS), PVC, and ceramic tiles). After exposure to the biofilm organisms for five days post-inoculation at 7°C we conducted quantitative PCR (qPCR) and plaque assays to determine whether MHV could remain both detectable and viable. Our data provides evidence that coronaviruses can remain viable on all the surfaces tested and are also able to integrate within an environmental biofilm. Although a portion of MHV was able to remain infectious after incubation with the environmental biofilm, a large reduction in plaque numbers was identified when compared with the viral inoculum incubated without biofilm on all test surfaces, which ranged from 6.45–9.27-fold higher. Interestingly, we observed a 2-fold increase in the virus-environmental biofilm biovolume when compared to biofilm without virus, indicating that the biofilm bacteria both detected and reacted to the virus. These results indicate a complex virus-environmental biofilm interaction. Although we observed better survival of MHV on a variety of surfaces commonly found in meat processing plants alone than with the biofilm, there is the potential for biofilms to protect virions from disinfecting agents, which has implications for the potential of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence within the meat processing plant environment. Also given the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, particularly for some of the variant strains such as omicron, having even a residual level of virus present represents a serious health hazard. The increase in biofilm biovolume in response to virus is also a concern for food safety due to the potential of the same being seen with organisms associated with food poisoning and food spoilage.",,,37285373,L2025128561,10.1371/journal.pone.0286659

We aimed to estimate the use of masks during Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests and whether these protests increased the risk of COVID-19. Two reviewers screened 496 protest images for mask use, with high inter-rater reliability. Protest intensity, use of tear gas, government control measures, and testing rates were estimated in 12 cities. A correlation analysis was conducted to assess the potential effect of mask use and other measures, adjusting for testing rates, on COVID-19 epidemiology 4 weeks (two incubation periods) post-protests. Mask use ranged from 69 to 96% across protests. There was no increase in the incidence of COVID-19 post-protest in 11 cities. After adjusting for testing rates, only Miami, which involved use of tear gas and had high protest intensity, showed a clear increase in COVID-19 after one incubation period post-protest. No significant correlation was found between incidence and protest factors. Our study showed that protests in most cities studied did not increase COVID-19 incidence in 2020, and a high level of mask use was seen. The absence of an epidemic surge within two incubation periods of a protest is indicative that the protests did not have a major influence on epidemic activity, except in Miami.

The mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenicity in the brain are not well understood. However, mounting evidence points towards the neurovascular unit as a target of infection. Aim: The aim was to validate the use of a non-transgenic rodent as a model organism to study the effects of SARSCoV2 infection in neural tissues and elucidate potential mechanisms of brain pathogenesis. We examined expression of ACE2 in adult Sprague-Dawley rats in vivo and the infectivity of Omicron variant B1.1.529 in rat endothelial and pericyte cells in vitro. Method: Double-label immunohistochemistry was performed in coronal brain sections from adult Sprague- Dawley rats to identify cells expressing ACE2 receptors. A recombinant-GFP tagged spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was used to evaluate COVID-19 infectivity in vitro. Cells were cultured from P1 rat pups. Endothelial cells and pericytes were cultured on transwell inserts. Permeability of the cell monolayer following RBD incubation was determined using a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyante dextran permeability assay. Results: In brain tissues ACE2 colocalized with PDGFR-B labelled cells. There was no colocalization of ACE2 with endothelial cells. Increasing concentrations (0.2-1.0 μg/ml) of RBD applied in vitro resulted in increased GFP fluorescence intensity. In transwell experiments, preliminary data indicates RBD uptake resulted in increased permeability in pericytes to 70 k dextran. Incubation of cultures with LL37 (cathelicidin) an antimicrobial peptide that has a high affinity to the S1 domain of the SARS-COV2 spike protein reduced the permeability of cell monolayers compared to RBD alone.

However, the impact of epidemic dynamics is often neglected in estimating the timing of infection—for example, when an epidemic is growing exponentially, a cohort of infected individuals who developed symptoms at the same time are more likely to have been infected recently. Here, we reanalyze incubation-period and serial-interval data describing transmissions of the Delta and Omicron variants from the Netherlands at the end of December 2021. Previous analysis of the same dataset reported shorter mean observed incubation period (3.2 d vs. 4.4 d) and serial interval (3.5 d vs. 4.1 d) for the Omicron variant, but the number of infections caused by the Delta variant decreased during this period as the number of Omicron infections increased. When we account for growth-rate differences of two variants during the study period, we estimate similar mean incubation periods (3.8 to 4.5 d) for both variants but a shorter mean generation interval for the Omicron variant (3.0 d; 95% CI: 2.7 to 3.2 d) than for the Delta variant (3.8 d; 95% CI: 3.7 to 4.0 d). The differences in estimated generation intervals may be driven by the “network effect”—higher effective transmissibility of the Omicron variant can cause faster susceptible depletion among contact networks, which in turn prevents late transmission (therefore shortening realized generation intervals). Using up-to-date generation-interval distributions is critical to accurately estimating the reproduction advantage of the Omicron variant.",,,37216529,L2025342463,10.1073/pnas.2221887120

However, both pathogen biology and changing host characteristics – such as varying levels of immunity – can combine to influence replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within and between hosts. Disentangling the role of variant and host in individual-level viral shedding of VOCs is essential to inform COVID-19 planning and response, and interpret past epidemic trends. Using data from a prospective observational cohort study of healthy adult volunteers undergoing weekly occupational health PCR screening, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct individual-level viral kinetics and estimate how different factors shaped viral dynamics, measured by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values over time. Jointly accounting for both inter-individual variation in Ct values and complex host characteristics – such as vaccination status, exposure history and age – we found that age and number of prior exposures had a strong influence on peak viral replication. Older individuals and those who had at least five prior antigen exposures to vaccination and/or infection typically had much lower levels of shedding. Moreover, we found evidence of a correlation between the speed of early shedding and duration of incubation period when comparing different VOCs and age groups. Our findings illustrate the value of linking information on participant characteristics, symptom profile and infecting variant with prospective PCR sampling, and the importance of accounting for increasingly complex population exposure landscapes when analysing the viral kinetics of VOCs.",,,,L2024975077,10.1101/2023.05.17.23290105

Date of Publication: 19 May 2023","2023",,,,,"19 May 2023","Background: After the first COVID-19 wave caused by the ancestral lineage, the pandemic has been fueled from the continuous emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Understanding key time-to-event periods for each emerging variant of concern is critical as it can provide insights into the future trajectory of the virus and help inform outbreak preparedness and response planning. Here, we aim to examine how the incubation period, serial interval, and generation time have changed from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 lineage to different variants of concern. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that synthesized the estimates of incubation period, serial interval, and generation time (both realized and intrinsic) for the ancestral lineage, Alpha, Beta, and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. Results: Our study included 274 records obtained from 147 household studies, contact tracing studies or studies where epidemiological links were known. With each emerging variant, we found a progressive shortening of each of the analyzed key time-to-event periods. Specifically, we found that Omicron had the shortest pooled estimates for the incubation period (3.63 days, 95%CI: 3.25-4.02 days), serial interval (3.19 days, 95%CI: 2.95-3.43 days), and realized generation time (2.96 days, 95%CI: 2.54-3.38 days) whereas the ancestral lineage had the highest pooled estimates for each of them. We also observed shorter pooled estimates for the serial interval compared to the incubation period across the virus lineages. We found considerable heterogeneities (I(2) > 80%) when pooling the estimates across different virus lineages, indicating potential unmeasured confounding from population factors (e.g., social behavior, deployed interventions). Conclusion: Our study supports the importance of conducting contact tracing and epidemiological investigations to monitor changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. Our findings highlight a progressive shortening of the incubation period, serial interval, and generation time, which can lead to epidemics that spread faster, with larger peak incidence, and harder to control. We also consistently found a shorter serial interval than incubation period, suggesting that a key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is the potential for pre-symptomatic transmission. These observations are instrumental to plan for future COVID-19 waves.",,,,L2024975145,10.1101/2023.05.19.23290208

Methods: A total of 55,111 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were quarantined in the National Exhibition & Convention Center (Shanghai) Fangcang shelter hospital within 3 days after diagnosis from April 9 to May 23, 2022 were enrolled. The kinetics of cycle threshold (Ct) values of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were assessed. The influencing factors for disease progression and the risk factors for the viral RNA shedding time (VST) were investigated. Results: On admission, 79.6% (43,852/55,111) of the cases were diagnosed with asymptomatic infections, and 20.4% were mild diseases. However, 78.0% of initially asymptomatic subjects developed mild diseases at the follow-up. The final proportion of asymptomatic infections was 17.5%. The median time of symptom onset, the duration of symptoms, and the VST were 2 days, 5 days, and 7 days, respectively. Female, age 19-40 years, underlying comorbidities with hypertension and diabetes, and vaccination were associated with higher risks of progressing to mildly symptomatic infections. In addition, mildly symptomatic infections were found to be associated with prolonged VST compared with asymptomatic infections. However, the kinetics of viral RNA decay and dynamics of Ct values were similar among asymptomatic subjects, patients with asymptomatic-to-mild infection, and patients with mild infection. Conclusion: A large proportion of initially diagnosed asymptomatic Omicron infections is in the presymptomatic stage.

Therefore, we developed a rapid platform to vectorize and screen anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAb codes deciphered from convalescent patient-derived memory B-cells. To achieve this, we vectorized the spike (SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein)-specific antibody codes into 3(rd) generation selfinactivating lentiviral vectors and produced recombinant human antibodies in HEK-293-T cells. To screen nAbs for their neutralizing capacities against viral escape, we incorporated all receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations from the recorded variants or variants of concern (VOCs), namely Wuhan, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Kappa, Delta+ (AY.2), IHU Méditerranée and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.4/5, and engineered their replication-incompetent pseudotyped vectors (pseudoviruses) using known retroviral vectors. Using a flowcytometric assay to detect pseudoviral infection, we screened over 90 monoclonal nAbs and identified three (C9, A7 and A9) that neutralize the Wuhan strain pseudovirus at IC(50) concentrations of 6, 9 and 22 ng/mL respectively, similar to the approved therapeutic antibodies. While all three monoclonal nAb candidates were effective (≈70-100% neutralization) against Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Kappa and Delta+ variants, they displayed lower efficacy (≈0-50%) to neutralize the Omicron BA.1 and IHU Méditerranée variants in a monotherapeutic setting. Existing nAb cocktail therapies (e.g. REGN-COV2 and Evusheld) have demonstrated the potential of two monoclonal nAbs to circumvent viral escape. Based on this evidence, we designed and produced an innovative tetravalent bispecific candidate (A7A9 TVB nAb) against immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 variants. A7A9 TVB nAb, which consists of four antigen-binding arms with specificity towards two distinct epitopes on the RBD, neutralized all tested VOCs better than its parental clones (except for Omicron BA.4/5, which has often been reported to evade neutralization by antibodies in other studies). Moreover, on differentiated primary nasal epithelium (DPNE, as an air-liquid interface culture) infected with authentic (full-length wild-type virus) Omicron BA.1, pre-incubation of the virus with A7A9 TVB nAb showed significantly reduced viral titers 24 hours post-infection as measured via a plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, stable A7A9 TVB nAb-expressing DPNE against authentic Omicron BA.1 showed a consistent decline in viral load, leading to viral clearance five days post-infection. These results strongly corroborate the clinical relevance of A7A9 TVB nAb. Additionally, to address the aspects of stability and specificity, we characterized all antibodies for their size and integrity using western blot analysis and validated their unique binding specificities through cell-based binding assays using stable cell lines expressing spike domains (S1, S2, NTD, RBD, NTD + RBD) as surface antigens. In summary, we have generated a new vectorization and screening platform for development of antibodies with modular designs that can be expanded to other infectious pathogens with urgent medical needs and beyond.",,,,L2025562187,10.1016/j.ymthe.2023.04.017

Little was known about the characteristics of Omicron variants in mainland China. Objective: To evaluate transmission characteristics of Omicron BA.5 variants and the effectiveness of inactivated vaccine (mainly BBIBP-CorV) against their transmission. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted using data from an Omicron-seeded COVID-19 outbreak in Urumqi from August 7 to September 7, 2022. Participants included all individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and their close contacts identified between August 7 and September 7, 2022 in Urumqi. Exposures: A booster dose was compared vs 2 doses (reference level) of inactivated vaccine and risk factors were evaluated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic characteristics, timeline records from exposure to laboratory testing outcomes, contact tracing history, and contact setting were obtained. The mean and variance of the key time-to-event intervals of transmission were estimated for individuals with known information. Transmission risks and contact patterns were assessed under different disease-control measures and in different contact settings. The effectiveness of inactivated vaccine against the transmission of Omicron BA.5 was estimated using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Among 1139 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 (630 females [55.3%]; mean [SD] age, 37.4 [19.9] years) and 51323 close contacts who tested negative for COVID-19 (26299 females [51.2%]; mean [SD] age, 38.4 [16.0] years), the means of generation interval, viral shedding period, and incubation period were estimated at 2.8 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2.4-3.5 days), 6.7 days (95% CrI, 6.4-7.1 days), and 5.7 days (95% CrI, 4.8-6.6 days), respectively.

Vaccine effectiveness against BA.5 variant transmission for the booster-dose vs 2 doses was 28.9% (95% CrI, 7.7%-45.2%) and 48.5% (95% CrI, 23.9%-61.4%) for 15-90 days after booster dose. No protective outcome was detected beyond 90 days after the booster dose.

Therefore, we designed, characterized, and evaluated the immunogenicity and protective potential of a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) fused to a stabilized S2. Designed immunogens were expressed as soluble proteins with approximately fivefold higher purified yield than the Spike ectodomain and formulated along with Squalene-in-water emulsion (SWE) adjuvant. S2 immunization failed to elicit a neutralizing immune response but significantly reduced lung viral titers in mice challenged with the heterologous Beta variant. In hamsters, SWE-formulated RS2 showed enhanced immunogenicity and efficacy relative to corresponding RBD and Spike formulations. Despite being based on the ancestral Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2, RS2 exhibited broad neutralization, including against Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.5 and BF.7), as well as the clade 1a WIV-1 and SARS-CoV-1 strains.

We fitted bias-controlled models to the data to estimate the serial interval, incubation period and infectiousness profile of the two variants. Viral load data were extracted and fitted to the random effect models to investigate the potential risk modifiers for the clinical viral shedding course. Totally 14 401 confirmed cases were reported between January 1 and February 15, 2022. The estimated mean serial interval (4.4 days vs. 5.8 days) and incubation period (3.4 days vs. 3.8 days) were shorter for the Omicron than the Delta variants. A larger proportion of presymptomatic transmission was observed for the Omicron (62%) compared to the Delta variants (48%). The Omicron cases had higher mean viral load over an infection course than the Delta cases, with the elder cases appearing more infectious than the younger cases for both variants. The epidemiological features of Omicron variants were likely an obstacle to contact tracing measures, imposed as a major intervention in settings like Hong Kong. Continuously monitoring the epidemiological feature for any emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future is needed to assist officials in planning measures for COVID-19 control.",,,36892159,L2022345337,10.1002/jmv.28648

Although vaccines are available, the immune evasion capabilities of the recent variants demand further efficient therapeutic choices to control the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Hence, considering the necessity of the small molecule inhibitor, we target the main protease (3CLpro), which is an appealing target for the development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. High-throughput molecular in silico screening of South African natural compounds database reported Isojacareubin and Glabranin as the potential inhibitors for the main protease. The calculated docking scores were reported to be −8.47 and −8.03 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, the structural dynamic assessment reported that Isojacareubin in complex with 3CLpro exhibit a more stable dynamic behavior than Glabranin. Inhibition assay indicated that Isojacareubin could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with half maximal inhibitory concentration values of 16.00 ± 1.35 μM (60 min incubation). Next, the covalent binding sites of Isojacareubin on SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) was identified by biomass spectrometry, which reported that Isojacareubin can covalently bind to thiols or Cysteine through Michael addition. To evaluate the inactivation potency of Isojacareubin, the inactivation kinetics was further investigated. The inactivation kinetic curves were plotted according to various concentrations with gradient-ascending incubation times. The K(I) value of Isojacareubin was determined as 30.71 μM, whereas the K(inact) value was calculated as 0.054 min(−1).

Methods: In April 2022, we carried out a household transmission study from 309 households of 335 SARS-CoV-2 pediatric cases referred to a designated tertiary Children's Hospital. The detailed information can be collected from the 297 households for estimating the transmission parameters. The 236 households were qualified for estimating the secondary infection attack rates (SAR(I)) and secondary clinical attack rates (SAR(C)) among adult household contacts, characterizing the transmission heterogeneities in infectivity and susceptibility, and assessing the vaccine effectiveness. Results: We estimated the mean incubation period and serial interval of Omicron variant to be 4.6 ± 2.1 and 3.9 ± 3.7 days, respectively, with 57.2% of the transmission events occurring at the presymptomatic phase. The overall SAR(I) and SAR(C) among adult household contacts were 77.11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.58%–80.63%) and 67.03% (63.09%–70.98%). We found higher household susceptibility in females.

In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the Omicron epidemic in Shanghai to explore the timing and performance of control measures based on the eventual size and duration of the outbreak. Methods: We constructed an age-structured and vaccination-stratified SEPASHRD model by considering populations that had been detected or controlled before symptom onset. In addition, we retrospectively modeled the epidemic in Shanghai from 26 February 2022 to 31 May 2022 across four periods defined by events and interventions, on the basis of officially reported confirmed (58,084) and asymptomatic (591,346) cases. Results: According to our model fitting, there were about 785,123 positive infections, of which about 57,585 positive infections were symptomatic infections. Our counterfactual assessment found that precise control by grid management was not so effective and that citywide static management was still needed. Universal and enforced control by citywide static management contained 87.65% and 96.29% of transmission opportunities, respectively. The number of daily new and cumulative infections could be significantly reduced if we implemented static management in advance. Moreover, if static management was implemented in the first 14 days of the epidemic, the number of daily new infections would be less than 10. Conclusions: The above research suggests that dynamic zeroing can only be achieved when strict prevention and control measures are implemented as early as possible. In addition, a lot of preparation is still needed if China wants to change its strategy in the future.",,,,L2021192016,10.3390/tropicalmed8010039

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2022","2022","22","1",,,"1 Dec 2022","Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading disease affecting human life and the economy on a global scale. The disease has caused so far more then 5.5 million deaths. The omicron outbreak that emerged in Botswana in the south of Africa spread around the globe at further increased rates, and caused unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 infection incidences in several countries. At the start of December 2021 the first omicron cases were reported in France. Methods: In this paper we investigate the spreading potential of this novel variant relatively to the delta variant that was also in circulation in France at that time. Using a dynamic multi-variant model accounting for cross-immunity through a status-based approach, we analyze screening data reported by Santé Publique France over 13 metropolitan French regions between 1st of December 2021 and the 30th of January 2022. During the investigated period, the delta variant was replaced by omicron in all metropolitan regions in approximately three weeks. The analysis conducted retrospectively allows us to consider the whole replacement time window and compare regions with different times of omicron introduction and baseline levels of variants’ transmission potential. As large uncertainties regarding cross-immunity among variants persist, uncertainty analyses were carried out to assess its impact on our estimations. Results: Assuming that 80% of the population was immunized against delta, a cross delta/omicron cross-immunity of 25% and an omicron generation time of 3.5 days, the relative strength of omicron to delta, expressed as the ratio of their respective reproduction rates, R^omicronR^delta, was found to range between 1.51 and 1.86 across regions. Uncertainty analysis on epidemiological parameters led to R^omicronR^delta ranging from 1.57 to 2.34 on average over the metropolitan French regions, weighted by population size. Conclusions: Upon introduction, omicron spread rapidly through the French territory and showed a high fitness relative to delta. We documented considerable geographical heterogeneities on the spreading dynamics. The historical reconstruction of variant emergence dynamics provide valuable ground knowledge to face future variant emergence events.",,,36324075,L2019944586,10.1186/s12879-022-07821-5

Hence, control measures are continuously being optimized to guard against large-scale coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the intensity of control measures in response to different SARS-CoV-2 variants and the degree of outbreak control at city level. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 49 cities with COVID-19 outbreaks between January 2020 and June 2022. Epidemiological data on COVID-19 were extracted from the National Health Commission, People’s Republic of China, and the population flow data were sourced from the Baidu migration data provided by the Baidu platform. Outbreak control was quantified by calculating the degree of infection growth and the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)). The intensity of the outbreak response was quantified by calculating the reduction in population mobility during the outbreak period. Correlation and regression analyses of the intensity of the control measures and the degree of outbreak control for the Omicron variant and non-Omicron mutants were conducted, respectively. Results: Overall, 65 outbreaks occurred in 49 cities in China from January 2020 to June 2022. Of them, 66.2% were Omicron outbreaks and 33.8% were non-Omicron outbreaks. The intensity of the control measures was positively correlated with the degree of outbreak control (r = 0.351, P = 0.03). The degree of reduction in population mobility was negatively correlated with the R(t) value (r = − 0.612, P < 0.01). Therefore, under the same control measure intensity, the number of new daily Omicron infections was 6.04 times higher than those attributed to non-Omicron variants, and the R(t) value of Omicron outbreaks was 2.6 times higher than that of non-Omicron variants. In addition, the duration of non-Omicron variant outbreaks was shorter than that of the outbreaks caused by the Omicron variant (23.0 ± 10.7, 32.9 ± 16.3, t = 2.243, P = 0.031). Conclusions: Greater intensity of control measures was associated with more effective outbreak control. Thus, in response to the Omicron variant, the management to restrict population movement should be used to control its spread quickly, especially in the case of community transmission occurs widely. Faster than is needed for non-Omicron variants, and decisive control measures should be imposed and dynamically adjusted in accordance with the evolving epidemic situation.",,,36434701,L2020248685,10.1186/s40249-022-01043-2

Methods: In this study, 311 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were divided into two groups. Data on the patients' demographic characteristics and laboratory tests, including platelet count (PLT), neutrophil count (NE), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum creatinine (SCR), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), were collected. The biomarkers for moderate and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and factors affecting the incubation period and time to subsequent negative nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were also investigated. Results: Age, gender, vaccination, hypertension, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/chronic bronchitis/asthma, and some laboratory tests were statistically different between the two groups. In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, PLT and CRP had higher area under the ROC curve values. In the multivariate analysis, age, hypertension, COPD/chronic bronchitis/asthma, and CRP were correlated with moderate and severe COVID-19. Moreover, age was correlated with longer incubation. In the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, gender (male), CRP, and NLR were associated with longer time to subsequent negative NAAT. Conclusions: Older patients with hypertension and lung diseases were likely to have moderate or severe COVID-19, and younger patients might have a shorter incubation.

And it may indicate superspreading events to reduce the efficiency of population-level control measures and to sustain the epidemic over a larger scale and a longer duration. Methods have been proposed to identify significant transmission heterogeneity in historic epidemics based on several data sources, such as contact history, viral genomes and spatial information, which may not be available, and more importantly ignore the temporal trend of transmission heterogeneity. Here we attempted to establish a convenient method to estimate real-time heterogeneity over an epidemic. Within the branching process framework, we introduced an instant-individualheterogenous infectiousness model to jointly characterize the variation in infectiousness both between individuals and among different times. With this model, we could simultaneously estimate the transmission heterogeneity and the reproduction number from incidence time series. We validated the model with data of both simulated and real outbreaks. Our estimates of the overall and real-time heterogeneities of the six epidemics were consistent with those presented in the literature. Additionally, our model is robust to the ubiquitous bias of under-reporting and misspecification of serial interval. By analyzing recent data from South Africa, we found evidence that the Omicron might be of more significant transmission heterogeneity than Delta. Our model based on incidence data was proved to be reliable in estimating the real-time transmission heterogeneity.",,,36455043,L2021974794,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010078

We aim to determine the trend in COVID-19 incubation periods during three distinct pandemic waves corresponding to different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Incubation Period Incubation period of the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variant in circulation Methods. This is an ecological study and information collected from the SingHealth COVID-19 Registry, a database of all inpatients admitted to any of the SingHealth hospitals. For patients under quarantine, the start date of the quarantine period was assumed to be the last date of exposure to the index case. Incubation period was determined by the duration between date of exposure and date of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The prevalent strain in circulation was identified from the Singapore database in the GISAID collection. Only variants of concern, as categorized by WHO, Alpha (23rd Jan 2020 - 1st Mar 2021), Delta (5th May 2021 - 31st Oct 2021) and Omicron (1st Jan 2022 - Present) were considered. For the Omicron variant, quarantine was discontinued, hence the last date of arrival from international travel was assumed to be the date of exposure. Results. From January 2020 to March 2022, there were 19,905 patients in the COVID-19 registry, of whom 11,235 were under quarantine and 8,612 had preceding international travel. Of the 11,235 patients under quarantine, 8,189 patients were infected when SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant and 3,046 patients were infected when SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant were in circulation. Of the 8,612 patients with preceding travel, 6,503 patients were infected when SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was in circulation.

We were interested in reviewing TC experience in Minnesota. Methods. Minnesota Department of Health established a voluntary TC patient registry in December 2021, including date of treatment, COVID-19 vaccination status and immunocompromising conditions. Patients were matched to state COVID-19 case data from December 1, 2021 to April 22, 2022, to examine occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (a positive test by PCR or antigen) following receipt of TC.

Date of Publication: 15 Nov 2022","2022","140",,"79","80","15 Nov 2022","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to infect millions of individuals worldwide. However, not all individuals are equally susceptible to infection. Many studies have demonstrated that the first polymorphism described in the human population, ABO(H) blood group antigens, are associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While conflicting data exist, the most common findings suggest that individuals with blood group A exhibit an increased risk of infection when compared to blood group O individuals. However, the mechanism whereby ABO(H) blood group status influences SARS-CoV-2 infection has remained unknown. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates host cell engagement, bears significant similarity to galectins, an ancient family of carbohydrate binding proteins previously shown to recognize ABO(H) blood group antigens. As a result, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may recognize blood group A directly through its RBD and that this may in part account for increased susceptibility of blood group A individuals for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: The SARS-CoV-2 RBD from the parent strain (Wuhan-Hu-1) and variants (Delta and Omicron), in addition to individual human galectins (1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9) were cloned, purified and subjected to glycan binding specificity analysis using a glycan microarray populated with hundreds of distinct glycans, including blood group antigens. This was accomplished by incubating each fluorescently labeled RBD or galectin on the array, followed by detection of bound fluorescence using a microarray scanner (GenePix 4000 B, Molecular devices) and integrated spot intensity analysis using Imagene software (GenePix Pro 7). SARS-CoV-2 with distinct spike proteins (Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta, and Omicron) were used to assess infection using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells engineered to express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type 1 blood group A or H (blood group O antigen). A one-way ANOVA with a Tukey's post hoc with a p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Sequence analysis of galectins demonstrates that several galectins possess up to 11% sequence identity with the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and variants (Delta and Omicron). Each RBD (Wuhan, Delta and Omicron) exhibited glycan binding specificity that overlapped with distinct members of the galectin family, with the highest similarity observed toward the C terminal domain of galectin-4 (Gal-4C). Direct comparison of binding toward ABO(H) antigens demonstrated that each RBD and Gal-4C displayed high specificity for the type 1 blood group A structure uniquely found on respiratory epithelial cells when compared to other blood group antigens (p<0.0001). To specifically examine the impact of blood group A on SARS-CoV-2 infection, CHO cells were engineered to express ACE2 and the type 1 blood group A or H antigen (the antigen expressed in blood group O individuals) normally found on respiratory epithelial cells. Consistent with the increased binding of the RBD to blood group A on the glycan microarray, enhanced binding was observed by each RBD toward blood group A expressing cells (p<0.001). Blood group A cells were also significantly more likely to be infected with Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 when compared to blood group O cells, while pre-incubation of cells with Gal-4C specifically inhibited infection of blood group A expressing cells, while failing to impact infection of blood group O cells (p<0.001). Conclusions: These results demonstrate a direct effect of blood group A on viral infection and suggest that blood group A individuals may exhibit an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 as a result of direct engagement of the blood group A antigen. However, variations in ACE2 levels, blood group A expression and many other factors likely influence the overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection following exposure in a given individual. The present results provide one mechanism whereby blood group A itself may directly influence SARS-CoV-2 infectious risk.

"Pathogenicity of Sars-Cov-2 Spike Protein Variants Correlates with Coagulation and Complement Assays","Gerber G., Pan X.-Z., Ranjan N., Warmack A., Brodsky R.","Blood (2022) 140 Supplement 1 (2705-2706). Date of Publication: 15 Nov 2022","2022","140",,"2705","2706","15 Nov 2022","Introduction: Infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is marked by both a localized and systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy leading to end organ damage and mortality. Notwithstanding individual patient risk factors and more widespread immunity, mutations in SARS-CoV-2, commonly involving the spike protein, have yielded fluctuations in disease manifestations and severity. Clinically, the first alpha (α) variant was marked by elevated incidence of thromboembolism, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality, whereas the omicron BA.1 (O) variant has been associated with lower rates of hospitalization, ICU admissions, and need for mechanical ventilation (Fan et. al. Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022). We previously showed that the S1 subunit of the α spike protein containing the receptor binding domain critical for viral host cell entry leads to dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement through binding to heparan sulfate and competing for binding of factor H. Further, complement amplification is associated with disease severity in hospitalized patients. Using ex vivo assays of complement and coagulation, we sought to characterize the effects of the S1 subunit from the α and O SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants as compared to the OC43 spike protein, a common human coronavirus associated with mild upper respiratory tract illness. Methods: The SARS-CoV-2 α variant S1 subunit (S1α) and Omicron variant BA.1.1.529 S1 (S1O) recombinant proteins were obtained from Raybiotech and human coronavirus OC43 recombinant spike protein (OC43 S) from Sino Biological. Complement assays including the modified Ham (mHam) test and flow cytometry for cell surface deposition of complement C5b-9 were performed as previously described using the spike proteins added to normal human serum (NHS) to activate complement on TF1PIGAnull cells (Yu et. al. Blood 2020). For coagulation assays, the spike proteins were incubated with THP-1 cells, a monocytic cell line, at 37°C in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. Tissue factor (TF) relative mRNA expression was quantified using RT-PCR at various time points and normalized to GADPH expression. After 6 hours incubation, cells (150,000-200,000 cells/well) were washed with PBS then resuspended in pooled human plasma. Clotting activity was measured by the recalcification time of the plasma using a BioTeK ELx808 plate reader at 405 nm. Ixolaris 20 nM (Francischetti et. al. Blood 2002), a tick salivary protein that inhibits FVIIa/TF-induced FX activation, was incubated with cells and plasma at 37°C for 10 minutes prior to plasma recalcification in select samples. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Data is presented as mean ± standard error. The Student t test was used to assess the difference between unpaired groups with a value of P<.05 considered statistically significant. Results: In the mHam test, addition of S1α 20 µg/mL to NHS led to significantly more complement-mediated cell killing after 2 hours as compared to S1O (P<.05) (Figure 1). A dose dependent effect was observed for S1α and S1O. S1α also led to increased deposition of C5b-9 on the TF1PIGAnull cell surface as compared to S1O (44.2% vs. 16.5% at 20 µg/mL and 35.8% vs. 15.3% at 10 µg/mL). OC43 did not lead to a significant increase in cell killing in the mHam or C5b-9 deposition on the cell surface as previously published (Yu et. al. Blood 2020). In the plasma recalcification assay, incubation of THP-1 cells with S1α at 20 µg/mL led to decreased time to initiation and peak clot formation as compared to S1O and OC43 S, which were comparable to the clotting observed with the cells alone (Figure 2). Addition of Ixolaris 20 nM prolonged time to clot formation in the S1α treated cells, suggesting that the faster rate of plasma clotting is at least in part TF dependent. Further, TF mRNA expression was increased more than threefold at 1 hour in the S1α (20 µg/mL) treated cells as compared to untreated cells. The maximum increase in TF expression for the S1O (20 µg/mL) treated cells was approximately 1.5x at 2 hours. Conclusions: TF activity and complement amplification induced by the coronavirus spike proteins in vitro correlates with their respective clinical phenotype and disease severity. This suggests that the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the complement and coagulation systems derive from the spike protein, and these assays may be useful in predicting pathogenicity of spike protein variants.

Date of Publication: 7 Nov 2022","2022",,,,,"7 Nov 2022","The severe shortfall in testing supplies during the initial COVID-19 outbreak and ensuing struggle to manage the pandemic have affirmed the critical importance of optimal supply-constrained resource allocation strategies for controlling novel disease epidemics. To address the challenge of constrained resource optimization for managing diseases with complications like pre- and asymptomatic transmission, we develop an integro partial differential equation compartmental disease model which incorporates realistic latent, incubation, and infectious period distributions along with limited testing supplies for identifying and quarantining infected individuals. Our model overcomes the limitations of typical ordinary differential equation compartmental models by decoupling symptom status from model compartments to allow a more realistic representation of symptom onset and presymptomatic transmission. To analyze the influence of these realistic features on disease controllability, we find optimal strategies for reducing total infection sizes that allocate limited testing resources between ‘clinical’ testing, which targets symptomatic individuals, and ‘non-clinical’ testing, which targets non-symptomatic individuals. We apply our model not only to the original, delta, and omicron COVID-19 variants, but also to generically parameterized disease systems with varying mismatches between latent and incubation period distributions, which permit varying degrees of presymptomatic transmission or symptom onset before infectiousness. We find that factors that decrease controllability generally call for reduced levels of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies, while the relationship between incubation-latent mismatch, controllability, and optimal strategies is complicated. In particular, though greater degrees of presymptomatic transmission reduce disease controllability, they may increase or decrease the role of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies depending on other disease factors like transmissibility and latent period length. Importantly, our model allows a spectrum of diseases to be compared within a consistent framework such that lessons learned from COVID-19 can be transferred to resource constrained scenarios in future emerging epidemics and analyzed for optimality.",,,,L2021629125,10.1101/2022.11.06.22281984

Date of Publication: 1 Nov 2022","2022","12","6","1259","1276","1 Nov 2022","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has indeed plunged the global community especially African countries into an alarming difficult situation culminating into a great deal amounts of catastrophes such as economic recession, political instability and loss of jobs. The pandemic spreads exponentially and causes loss of lives. Following the outbreak of the omicron new variant of concern, forecasting and identification of the COVID-19 infection cases is very vital for government at various levels. Hence, having knowledge of the spread at a particular point in time, swift actions can be taken by government at various levels with a view to accordingly formulate new policies and modalities towards minimizing the trajectory of the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic to both public health and economic sectors. Methods: Here, a potent combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learning algorithm along with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) learning algorithm has been proposed in this work in order to produce a hybrid of a deep learning algorithm Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) for forecasting COVID-19 infection cases particularly in Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana. Forecasting models for COVID-19 infection cases in Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana, were developed for 10 days using deep learning-based approaches namely CNN, LSTM and CNN-LSTM deep learning algorithm respectively. Results: The models were evaluated on the basis of four standard performance evaluation metrics which include accuracy, MSE, MAE and RMSE respectively. However, the CNN-LSTM deep learning-based forecasting model achieved the best accuracy of 98.30%, 97.60%, and 97.74% for Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana respectively; and in the same manner, achieved lesser MSE, MAE and RMSE values compared to models developed with CNN and LSTM respectively. Conclusions: Taken together, the CNN-LSTM deep learning-based forecasting model for COVID-19 infection cases in Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana dramatically surpasses the two other DL based forecasting models (CNN and LSTM) for COVID-19 infection cases in Nigeria, South Africa and Botswana in terms of not only the best accuracy of with 98.30%, 97.60%, and 97.74% but also in terms of lesser MSE, MAE and RMSE.",,,,L2020106383,10.1007/s12553-022-00711-5

However, not all individuals are equally susceptible to infection. Many studies have demonstrated that the first polymorphism described in the human population, ABO(H) blood group antigens, are associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While conflicting data exist, the most common findings suggest that individuals with blood group A exhibit an increased risk of infection when compared to blood group O individuals. However, the mechanism whereby ABO(H) blood group status influences SARS-CoV-2 infection has remained unknown. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates host cell engagement, bears significant similarity to galectins, an ancient family of carbohydrate binding proteins previously shown to recognize ABO(H) blood group antigens. Sequence analysis of galectins demonstrates that several galectins possess up to 11% sequence identity with the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and variants (Delta and Omicron). Each RBD (Wuhan, Delta and Omicron) exhibited glycan binding specificity that overlapped with distinct members of the galectin family, with the highest similarity observed toward the C terminal domain of galectin-4 (Gal-4C). Direct comparison of binding toward ABO(H) antigens demonstrated that each RBD and Gal-4C displayed high specificity for the type 1 blood group A structure uniquely found on respiratory epithelial cells when compared to other blood group antigens. To specifically examine the impact of blood group A on SARS-CoV-2 infection, CHO cells were engineered to express ACE2 and the type 1 blood group A or H antigen (blood group O) normally found on respiratory epithelial cells. Consistent with the increased binding of the RBD to blood group A on the glycan microarray, enhanced binding was observed by each RBD toward blood group A expressing cells. Blood group A cells were also significantly more likely to be infected with Wuhan-Hu-1, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 when compared to blood group O cells, while pre-incubation of cells with Gal-4C specifically inhibited infection of blood group A expressing cells, while failing to impact infection of blood group O cells. These results demonstrate a direct effect of blood group A on viral infection and suggest that blood group A individuals may exhibit an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 as a result of direct engagement of the blood group A antigen. However, variations in ACE2 levels, blood group A expression and many other factors likely influence the overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection following exposure in a given individual. The present results provide one mechanism whereby blood group A itself may directly influence SARS-CoV-2 infectious risk.",,,,L639616116,10.1093/glycob/cwac066

Date of Publication: 14 Oct 2022","2022","12","1","17221",,"14 Oct 2022","For SARS-CoV-2, R0 calculations in the range of 2-3 dominate the literature, but much higher estimates have also been published. Because capacity for RT-PCR testing increased greatly in the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, R0 determinations based on these incidence values are subject to strong bias. We propose to use Covid-19-induced excess mortality to determine R0 regardless of RT-PCR testing capacity. We used data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) on the incidence of Covid cases, Covid-related deaths, number of RT-PCR tests performed, and excess mortality calculated from data from the Federal Statistical Office in Germany. We determined R0 using exponential growth estimates with a serial interval of 4.7 days. We used only datasets that were not yet under the influence of policy measures (e.g., lockdowns or school closures). The uncorrected R0 value for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR incidence data was 2.56 (95% CI 2.52-2.60) for Covid-19 cases and 2.03 (95% CI 1.96-2.10) for Covid-19-related deaths. However, because the number of RT-PCR tests increased by a growth factor of 1.381 during the same period, these R0 values must be corrected accordingly (R0corrected = R0uncorrected/1.381), yielding 1.86 for Covid-19 cases and 1.47 for Covid-19 deaths. The R0 value based on excess deaths was calculated to be 1.34 (95% CI 1.32-1.37). A sine-function-based adjustment for seasonal effects of 40% corresponds to a maximum value of R0January = 1.68 and a minimum value of R0July = 1.01. Our calculations show an R0 that is much lower than previously thought. This relatively low range of R0 fits very well with the observed seasonal pattern of infection across Europe in 2020 and 2021, including the emergence of more contagious escape variants such as delta or omicron. In general, our study shows that excess mortality can be used as a reliable surrogate to determine the R0 in pandemic situations.",,,36241688,L639277557,10.1038/s41598-022-22101-7

A key performance indicator that has been proposed to evaluate contact tracing is the proportion of cases arising from known contacts. However, few empirical studies have investigated the effectiveness of contact tracing. Methods Using data collected between September 2020 and December 2021 in Belgium, we investigated the impact of contact tracing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We compared confirmed cases that were previously identified as a close contact to those that were not yet known, in terms of their traced contacts and secondary cases as well as the serial interval. In addition, we established contact and transmission patterns by age. Findings Previously traced, hence ‘known’, cases comprised 20% of all cases and they were linked to relatively fewer close contacts as well as fewer secondary cases and a lower secondary attack rate compared to cases that were not already known. In addition we observed a shorter serial interval for ‘known’ cases. There was a relative increase in transmission from children to adults during circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants, without an increase in the extent of contact between these age groups. Interpretation These results suggest that contact tracing in Belgium has been effective in reducing onward transmission and that individuals aware of their exposure to SARSCoV-2 seemed more reserved in their social contact behaviour. Data from a reference period or region are needed to measure the impact of contact tracing in terms of the number of cases and deaths averted.",,,,L2021043354,10.1101/2022.10.04.22280542

Quantitative estimation of the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples could help physicians make decisions on clinical treatment and patient management. Here, we propose to use a quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) method to evaluate the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in samples. We used threshold time (TT) values of qLAMP, the isothermal incubation time required for the fluorescent or colorimetric signal to reach the threshold, to indicate the viral load of clinical samples. Similar to the cycle threshold (C(t)) values in conventional qPCR, TT values of qLAMP show a linear relationship to the copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2. The higher the viral loadings, the lower qLAMP TT values are. The RT-qLAMP assay was demonstrated to quantify the viral loads of synthesized full-length RNA, inactivated viral particles (BBIBP-CorV), and clinical samples within 15 min by fluorescent reading and 25 min by colorimetric reading. The RT-qLAMP has been applied to detect Alpha, Beta, Kappa, Delta, and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the human beta-actin gene, and their TT values showed the linear patterns. The RT-qLAMP assays were evaluated by 64 clinical samples (25 positives and 39 negatives) for the assessment of viral loads, and it was also used to quantify the human beta-actin gene, which was used as a control and an indicator of sampling quality in clinical swab samples.

Taking this into account, we include compartments for multiple vaccinations and mutant viruses of COVID-19 in the model. In particular, our model considers breakthrough infection according to the antibody formation rate following multiple vaccinations. We obtain the effective reproduction numbers of the original virus, the Delta, and the Omicron variants by fitting this model to data in Korea. Additionally, we provide various simulations adjusting the daily vaccination rate and the timing of vaccination to investigate the effects of these two vaccine-related measures on the number of infected individuals. We also show that starting vaccinations early is the key to reduce the number of infected individuals. Delaying the start date requires increasing substantially the rate of vaccination to achieve similar target results.

We investigated the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a primary school setting with and without public health measures, using fine-grained physical positioning traces captured before the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Approximately 172.63 million position data from 98 students and six teachers from an open-plan primary school were used to predict a potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in primary school settings. We first estimated the daily average number of contacts of students and teachers with an infected individual during the incubation period. We then used the Reed-Frost model to estimate the probability of transmission per contact for the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron variant (B.1.1.529). Finally, we built a binomial distribution model to estimate the probability of onward transmission in schools with and without public health measures, including face masks and physical distancing. Results: An infectious student would have 49.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 46.1-52.1) contacts with their peers and 2.00 (95% CI = 1.82-2.18) contacts with teachers per day. An infectious teacher would have 47.6 (95% CI = 45.1-50.0) contacts with students and 1.70 (95% CI = 1.48-1.92) contacts with their colleague teachers per day. While the probability of onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission was relatively low for the Alpha and Delta variants, the risk increased for the Omicron variant, especially in the absence of public health measures. Onward teacher-to-student transmission (88.9%, 95% CI = 88.6%-89.1%) and teacher-to-teacher SARS-CoV-2 transmission (98.4%, 95% CI = 98.5%-98.6%) were significantly higher for the Omicron variant without public health measures in place. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that, despite a lower frequency of close contacts, teacher-to-teacher close contacts demonstrated a higher risk of transmission per contact of SARS-CoV-2 compared to student-to-student close contacts. This was especially significant with the Omicron variant, with onward transmission more likely occurring from teacher index cases than student index cases. Public health measures (eg, face masks and physical distance) seem essential in reducing the risk of onward transmission within school environments.",,,36181503,L639165384,10.7189/jogh.12.05034

We used a case-ascertained study to determine the features of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in Shanghai, China. Methods: We collected detailed information on 323 pediatric cases and their 951 household members in April 2022 during the Omicron outbreak. All household members received consecutively intensive RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and routine symptom monitoring within 14 days after exposure to a confirmed case. We described the characteristics of study participants and estimated the transmission parameters. Both secondary infection attack rates (SAR(I)) and secondary clinical attack rates (SAR(C)) among adult household contacts were computed, through which the transmission heterogeneities in infectivity and susceptibility were characterized and the vaccine effectiveness were estimated. Results: We estimated the mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant to be 4.6 (median: 4.4, IQR: 3.1-6.0) days and the mean serial interval to be 3.9 (median:4.0, IQR: 1.4-6.5) days. The overall SAR(I) and SAR(C) among adult household contacts were 77.11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.58%-80.63%) and 67.03% (63.09%-70.98%). We found higher household susceptibility in females, while infectivity was not significantly different in primary cases by age, sex, vaccination status and clinical severity. The estimated VEs of full vaccination was 14.8% (95% CI: 5.8%-22.9%) against Omicron infection and 21.5% (95% CI: 10.4%-31.2%) against symptomatic disease.

Several of its activities might be associated with the protein's ability to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation. N(SARS-CoV-2) contains an intrinsically disordered region at its N-terminus (NTE) that can be phosphorylated and is affected by mutations found in human COVID-19 infections, including in the Omicron variant of concern. Here, we show that NTE deletion decreases the range of RNA concentrations that can induce phase separation of N(SARS-CoV-2). In addition, deletion of the prion-like NTE allows N(SARS-CoV-2) droplets to retain their liquid-like nature during incubation. We further demonstrate that RNA-binding engages multiple parts of the NTE and changes NTE's structural properties. The results form the foundation to characterize the impact of N-terminal mutations and post-translational modifications on the molecular properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein.

Notably, while IgG anti-RBD antibodies were detectable in >80% of the HT recipients, only about half demonstrated neutralization efficiency against the omicron variant. A SARS-CoV-2-specific-T-cell response following the fourth dose was evident in the majority of transplant recipients. Boosting vulnerable groups improves antibody responses (including neutralizing responses) and cellular immunity, but the incomplete immunological response, particularly for omicron, suggests continued preventive measures and optimization of vaccination strategies that elicit strong, and long-lasting immune responses, in this high-risk population, should remain a priority.",,,35794051,L2019104008,10.1016/j.healun.2022.04.014

Within weeks of the first report of B.1.1.529, this VoC has rapidly spread throughout the world, replacing previously circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 and leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases even in populations with high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. Studies have shown that B.1.1.529 is less sensitive to protective antibody conferred by previous infections and vaccines developed against earlier lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The ability of B.1.1.529 to spread even among vaccinated populations has led to a global public health demand for updated vaccines that can confer protection against B.1.1.529. Methods: We rapidly developed a replicating RNA vaccine expressing the B.1.1.529 spike and evaluated immunogenicity in mice and hamsters. We also challenged hamsters with B.1.1.529 and evaluated whether vaccination could protect against viral shedding and replication within respiratory tissue. Findings: We found that mice previously immunized with A.1-specific vaccines failed to elevate neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.1.529 following B.1.1.529-targeted boosting, suggesting pre-existing immunity may impact the efficacy of B.1.1.529-targeted boosters. Furthermore, we found that our B.1.1.529-targeted vaccine provides superior protection compared to the ancestral A.1-targeted vaccine in hamsters challenged with the B.1.1.529 VoC after a single dose of each vaccine. Interpretation: Our data suggest that B.1.1.529-targeted vaccines may provide superior protection against B.1.1.529 but pre-existing immunity and timing of boosting may need to be considered for optimum protection.

These observations suggest that the increased transmissibility of BA.2 cannot be explained by the antibody evasion. Methods: Here, we characterized the replication competence and respiratory tissue tropism of three Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2), and compared these with the wild-type virus and Delta variant, in human nasal, bronchial and lung tissues cultured ex vivo. Findings: BA.2 replicated more efficiently in nasal and bronchial tissues at 33°C than wild-type, Delta and BA.1. Both BA.2 and BA.1 had higher replication competence than wild-type and Delta viruses in bronchial tissues at 37°C. BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2 replicated at a lower level in lung parenchymal tissues compared to wild-type and Delta viruses. Interpretation: Higher replication competence of Omicron BA.2 in the human upper airway at 33°C than BA.1 may be one of the reasons to explain the current advantage of BA.2 over BA.1. A lower replication level of the tested Omicron variants in human lung tissues is in line with the clinical manifestations of decreased disease severity of patients infected with the Omicron strains compared with other ancestral strains.

Vaccine distribution in low- and middle-income countries has been variable and reliant on diverse vaccine platforms. We studied B-cell immunity in Mexico, a middle-income country where five different vaccines have been deployed to populations with high SARS-CoV-2 incidences. Levels of antibodies that bound a stabilized prefusion spike trimer, neutralizing antibody titers, and memory B-cell expansion correlated with each other across vaccine platforms. Nevertheless, the vaccines elicited variable levels of B-cell immunity, and the majority of recipients had undetectable neutralizing activity against the recently emergent omicron variant. SARS-CoV-2 infection, experienced before or after vaccination, potentiated B-cell immune responses and enabled the generation of neutralizing activity against omicron and SARS-CoV for all vaccines in nearly all individuals. These findings suggest that broad population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will eventually be achieved but by heterogeneous paths. IMPORTANCE The majority of studies on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-elicited immunity and immune evasion have focused on single vaccines corresponding to those distributed in high-income countries. However, in low- and middle-income countries, vaccine deployment has been far less uniform. It is therefore important to determine the levels of immunity elicited by vaccines that have been deployed globally. Such data should help inform policy. Thus, this paper is very much a “real-world” study that focuses on a middle-income country, Mexico, in which five different vaccines based on mRNA, adenovirus, and inactivated-virus platforms have been extensively deployed, while (as documented in our study) SARS-CoV-2 variants with increasing degrees of immune evasiveness have propagated in the Mexican population, culminating in the recent emergence of B.1.1.529 (omicron).",,,35735743,L2020005217,10.1128/mbio.00840-22

Objective: To systematically assess the incubation period of COVID-19 and the incubation periods of COVID-19 caused by different SARS-CoV-2 variants in published studies. Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect were searched between December 1, 2019, and February 10, 2022. Study Selection: Original studies of the incubation period of COVID-19, defined as the time from infection to the onset of signs and symptoms. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline, 3 reviewers independently extracted the data from the eligible studies in March 2022. The parameters, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values, were derived from random-effects meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The mean estimate of the incubation period and different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Results: A total of 142 studies with 8112 patients were included. The pooled incubation period was 6.57 days (95% CI, 6.26-6.88) and ranged from 1.80 to 18.87 days.

The potential threat posed by the rapid spread of this variant in Germany remained, at the time, elusive. METHODS We developed a variant-dependent population-averaged susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) infectious disease model. The model was calibrated on the observed fixation dynamics of the Omicron variant in December 2021, and allowed us to estimate potential courses of upcoming infection waves in Germany, focusing on the corresponding burden on intensive care units (ICUs) and the efficacy of contact reduction strategies. RESULTS A maximum median incidence of approximately 300 000 (50% PI in 1000: [181,454], 95% PI in 1000: [55,804]) reported cases per day was expected with the median peak occurring in the mid of February 2022, reaching a cumulative Omicron case count of 16.5 million (50% PI in mio: [11.4, 21.3], 95% PI in mio: [4.1, 27.9]) until Apr 1, 2022. These figures were in line with the actual Omicron waves that were subsequently observed in Germany with respective peaks occurring in mid February (peak: 191k daily new cases) and mid March (peak: 230k daily new cases), cumulatively infecting 14.8 million individuals during the study period. The model peak incidence was observed to be highly sensitive to variations in the assumed generation time and decreased with shorter generation time. Low contact reductions were expected to lead to containment. Early, strict, and short contact reductions could have led to a strong “rebound” effect with high incidences after the end of the respective non-pharmaceutical interventions. Higher vaccine uptake would have led to a lower outbreak size. To ensure that ICU occupancy remained below maximum capacity, a relative risk of requiring ICU care of 10%–20% was necessary (after infection with Omicron vs. infection with Delta). CONCLUSIONS We expected a large cumulative number of infections with the VOC Omicron in Germany with ICU occupancy likely remaining below capacity nevertheless, even without additional non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our estimates were in line with the retrospectively observed waves. The results presented here informed legislation in Germany. The methodology developed in this study might be used to estimate the impact of future waves of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.",,,,L2019602918,10.1101/2022.07.07.22277391
"Inferring the differences in incubation-period and generation-interval distributions of the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2","Park S.W., Sun K., Abbott S., Sender R., Bar-On Y., Weitz J.S., Funk S., Grenfell B.T., Backer J.A., Wallinga J., Viboud C., Dushoff J.","medRxiv (2022). Date of Publication: 5 Jul 2022","2022",,,,,"5 Jul 2022","Estimating the differences in the incubation-period, serial-interval, and generation-interval distributions of SARS-CoV-2 variants is critical to understanding their transmission and control. However, the impact of epidemic dynamics is often neglected in estimating the timing of infection and transmission—for example, when an epidemic is growing exponentially, a cohort of infected individuals who developed symptoms at the same time are more likely to have been infected recently. Here, we re-analyze incubation-period and serial-interval data describing transmissions of the Delta and Omicron variants from the Netherlands at the end of December 2021. Previous analysis of the same data set reported shorter mean observed incubation period (3.2 days vs 4.4 days) and serial interval (3.5 days vs 4.1 days) for the Omicron variant, but the number of infections caused by the Delta variant decreased during this period as the number of Omicron infections increased. When we account for growth-rate differences of two variants during the study period, we estimate similar mean incubation periods (3.8–4.5 days) for both variants but a shorter mean generation interval for the Omicron variant (3.0 days; 95% CI: 2.7–3.2 days) than for the Delta variant (3.8 days; 95% CI: 3.7–4.0 days). We further note that the differences in estimated generation intervals may be driven by the “network effect”—higher effective transmissibility of the Omicron variant can cause faster susceptible depletion among contact networks, which in turn prevents late transmission (therefore shortening realized generation intervals). Using up-to-date generation-interval distributions is critical to accurately estimating the reproduction advantage of the Omicron variant. Significance Recent studies suggest that individuals infected with the Omicron variant develop symptoms earlier (shorter incubation period) and transmit faster (shorter generation interval) than those infected with the Delta variant. However, these studies typically neglect population-level effects: when an epidemic is growing, a greater proportion of current cases were infected recently, biasing us toward observing faster transmission events. Accounting for this dynamical bias, we find that Omicron infections from the Netherlands at the end of December 2021 had similar incubation periods, but shorter generation intervals, compared to Delta infections from the same period. Shorter generation intervals of the Omicron variant might be due to its higher effective reproduction number, which can cause faster local susceptible depletion around the contact network.",,,,L2019602786,10.1101/2022.07.02.22277186

To study mechanisms of viral entry and potentially identify specific inhibitors, we pseudotyped lentiviral vectors with different SARS-CoV-2 VOC spike variants (D614G, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron/BA.1), responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. These SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudoviruses were applied to screen 774 FDA-approved drugs. For the assay we decided to use CaCo2 cells, since they equally allow cell entry through both the direct membrane fusion pathway mediated by TMPRSS2 and the endocytosis pathway mediated by cathepsin-L. The active molecules which showed stronger differences in their potency to inhibit certain SARS-CoV-2 VOCs included antagonists of G-protein coupled receptors, like phenothiazine-derived antipsychotic compounds such as Chlorpromazine, with highest activity against the Omicron pseudovirus. In general, our data showed that the various VOCs differ in their preferences for cell entry, and we were able to identify synergistic combinations of inhibitors. Notably, Omicron singled out by relying primarily on the endocytosis pathway while Delta preferred cell entry via membrane fusion.

Date of Publication: 29 Jun 2022","2022",,,,,"29 Jun 2022","Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading disease affecting human life and the economy on a global scale. The disease has caused so far more then 5.5 million deaths. The omicron outbreak that emerged in Botswana in the south of Africa spread around the globe at further increased rates, and caused unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 infection incidences in several countries. At the start of December 2021 the first omicron cases were reported in France. Methods: In this paper we investigate the contagiousness of this novel variant relatively to the delta variant that was also in circulation in France at that time. Using a dynamic multi-variant model accounting for cross-immunity through a status-based approach, we analyze screening data reported by Santé Publique France over 13 metropolitan French regions between 1st of December 2021 and the 30th of January 2022. During the investigated period, the delta variant was replaced by omicron in all metropolitan regions in approximately three weeks. The analysis conducted retrospectively allows us to consider the whole replacement time window and compare regions with different times of omicron introduction and baseline levels of variants’ transmission potential. As large uncertainties regarding cross-immunity among variants persist, uncertainty analyses were carried out to assess its impact on our estimations. Results: Assuming that 80% of the population was immunized against delta, a cross delta/omicron cross-immunity of 25% and omicron generation time was 3.5 days, the relative strength of omicron to delta, expressed as the ratio of their respective reproduction rates, (R)(R)(omicron)(delta) , was found to range between 1.51 and 1.86 across regions. Uncertainty analysis on epidemiological parameters led to (R)(R)(omicron)(delta) ranging over 1.57-2.13 when averaged over the metropolitan French regions, weighting by population size. Conclusions: Upon introduction, omicron spread rapidly through the French territory and showed a high fitness relative to delta. We documented considerable geographical heterogeneities on the spreading dynamics. The historical reconstruction of variant emergence dynamics provide valuable ground knowledge to face future variant emergence events.",,,,L2019150535,10.1101/2022.06.28.22277015

Using a mathematical model describing trajectories of variant frequencies that assumes a constant ratio in mean generation times and a constant ratio in effective reproduction numbers among variants, trajectories of variant frequencies in Denmark from November 22, 2021 to February 26, 2022 were analyzed. We found that the mean generation time of Omicron BA.1 is 0.44-0.46 times that of Delta and the effective reproduction number of Omicron BA.1 is 1.88-2.19 times larger than Delta under the epidemiological conditions at the time. We also found that the mean generation time of Omicron BA.2 is 0.76-0.80 times that of BA.1 and the effective reproduction number of Omicron BA.2 is 1.25-1.27 times larger than Omicron BA.1. These estimates on the ratio of mean generation times and the ratio of effective reproduction numbers have epidemiologically important implications. The contact tracing for Omicron BA.2 infections must be done more quickly than that for BA.1 to stop further infections by quarantine.

Currently available vaccines have shown 90% or better rates of protection against severe disease and mortality. Barely a year after vaccines became available, the Omicron variant and its unprecedented speed of transmission has posed a new challenge. Overall, Omicron presents increased immune escape, transmissibility, and decreased pathogenicity. Vaccines do not offer a full protection against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, since “breakthrough” infections may occur in fully vaccinated individuals, who may in turn spread the virus to others. Breakthrough infections may be causally related to the viral profile (viral variant and load, incubation period, transmissibility, pathogenicity, immune evasion), immunity characteristics (mucosal versus systemic immunity, duration of immunity, etc.), host determinants (age, comorbidities, immune status, immunosuppressive drugs) and vaccination properties (platform, antigen dose, dose number, dose interval, route of administration). Determining the rate of breakthrough infections may be challenging and necessitates the conduction of population-based studies regarding vaccine effectiveness as well as neutralizing antibody testing, a surrogate of immune protection. In this review, we analyze the causes of breakthrough infections, their clinical consequences (severity of infection and transmission), methods of determining their incidence as well as challenges and perspectives. Long COVID as well as multi-inflammatory syndrome in adolescents may be significantly reduced in breakthrough infections. The need for universal pancoranavirus vaccines that would aim at protecting against a plethora of SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as emerging variants is discussed.

Although the short generation time of the Omicron variant increases the effectiveness of vaccination and the reduction of interpersonal contact, it decreases the effectiveness of early isolation. The latter feature may make the containment of case clusters difficult.

The delta variant is associated with increased transmissibility compared with the alpha variant, which was the dominant variant in the UK between December, 2020, and May, 2021. To understand transmission and the effectiveness of interventions, we aimed to investigate whether the delta variant generation time (the interval between infections in infector–infectee pairs) is shorter—ie, transmissions are happening more quickly—than that of the alpha variant. Methods: In this epidemiological analysis, we analysed transmission data from an ongoing UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) prospective household study. Households were recruited to the study after an index case had a positive PCR test and genomic sequencing was used to determine the variant responsible. By fitting a mathematical transmission model to the data, we estimated the intrinsic generation time (which assumes a constant supply of susceptible individuals throughout infection) and the household generation time (which reflects realised transmission in the study households, accounting for susceptible depletion) for the alpha and delta variants. Findings: Between February and August, 2021, 227 households consisting of 559 participants were recruited to the UKHSA study. The alpha variant was detected or assumed to be responsible for infections in 131 households (243 infections in 334 participants) recruited in February–May, and the delta variant in 96 households (174 infections in 225 participants) in May–August. The mean intrinsic generation time was shorter for the delta variant (4·7 days, 95% credible interval [CI] 4·1–5·6) than the alpha variant (5·5 days, 4·7–6·5), with 92% posterior probability.

Interpretation: The delta variant transmits more quickly in households than the alpha variant, which can be attributed to faster depletion of susceptible individuals in households and a possible decrease in the intrinsic generation time.

Using VSV-based pseudovirus, we found that sera from individuals vaccinated by two doses of inactivated whole-virion vaccines (BBIBP-CorV) showed very weak to no neutralization activity, while a homologous inactivated vaccine booster or a heterologous booster with protein subunit vaccine (ZF2001) markedly improved the neutralization titers against all Omicron variants. The comparison between sub-lineages indicated that BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3 had comparable or even greater antibody resistance than BA.1. We further evaluated the neutralization profile of a panel of 20 mAbs, including 10 already authorized or approved, against these Omicron sub-lineages as well as viruses with different Omicron spike single or combined mutations. Most mAbs lost their neutralizing activity completely or substantially, while some demonstrated distinct neutralization patterns among Omicron sub-lineages, reflecting their antigenic difference.

The neutralising ability of different vaccines alone or with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection against omicron is not well-known. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we tested the ability of vaccine and natural infection induced antibodies to neutralise omicron variant in a live virus neutralisation assay in four groups of individuals: (i) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, (ii) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, (iii) vaccination with inactivated virus vaccine (BBV152), and (iv) BBV152 vaccination plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcome was fold-change in virus neutralisation titre against omicron compared with ancestral virus. Findings: We included 80 subjects. The geometric mean titre (GMT) of the 50% focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT50) was 380·4 (95% CI: 221·1, 654·7) against the ancestral virus with BBV152 vaccination and 379·3 (95% CI: 185·6, 775·2) with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination alone. GMT for vaccination plus infection groups were 806·1 (95% CI: 478·5, 1357·8) and 1526·2 (95% CI: 853·2, 2730·0), respectively. Against omicron variant, only 5 out of 20 in both BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine only groups, 6 out of 20 in BBV152 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection group, and 9 out of 20 in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection group exhibited neutralisation titres above the lower limit of quantification (1:20) suggesting better neutralisation with prior infection. A reduction of 26·6 and 25·7 fold in FRNT50 titres against Omicron compared to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed for individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection vaccinated with BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, respectively. The corresponding reduction was 57·1 and 58·1 fold, respectively, for vaccinated individuals with prior infection. The 50% neutralisation titre against omicron demonstrated moderate correlation with serum anti-RBD IgG levels [Spearman r: 0·58 (0·41, 0·71)]. Interpretation: Significant reduction in the neutralising ability of both vaccine-induced and vaccine plus infection-induced antibodies was observed for omicron variant which might explain immune escape.

Notably, we observed a heightened requirement for VPS29 by the recently described Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the ancestral variant. However, VPS29 deficiency had no effect on certain other viruses that enter cells via endosomes and had an opposing, enhancing effect on influenza A virus infection. Deficiency in VPS29 or other retromer components caused changes in endosome morphology and acidity and attenuated the activity of endosomal proteases. These changes in endosome properties caused incoming coronavirus, but not influenza virus particles, to become entrapped therein. Overall, these data show how host regulation of endosome characteristics can influence cellular susceptibility to viral infection and identify a host pathway that could serve as a pharmaceutical target for intervention in zoonotic viral diseases.",,,35229640,L2017879718,10.1128/mbio.03002-21

Date of Publication: 10 Jan 2022","2022",,,,,"10 Jan 2022","Background Early estimates from South Africa indicated that the Omicron COVID-19 variant may be both more transmissible and have greater immune escape than the previously dominant Delta variant. The rapid turnover of the latest epidemic wave in South Africa as well as initial evidence from contact tracing and household infection studies has prompted speculation that the generation time of the Omicron variant may be shorter in comparable settings than the generation time of the Delta variant. Methods We estimated daily growth rates for the Omicron and Delta variants in each UKHSA region from the 23rd of November to the 23rd of December 2021 using surveillance case counts by date of specimen and S-gene target failure status with an autoregressive model that allowed for time-varying differences in the transmission advantage of the Delta variant where the evidence supported this. By assuming a gamma distributed generation distribution we then estimated the generation time distribution and transmission advantage of the Omicron variant that would be required to explain this time varying advantage. We repeated this estimation process using two different prior estimates for the generation time of the Delta variant first based on household transmission and then based on its intrinsic generation time. Results Visualising our growth rate estimates provided initial evidence for a difference in generation time distributions. Assuming a generation time distribution for Delta with a mean of 2.5-4 days (90% credible interval) and a standard deviation of 1.9-3 days we estimated a shorter generation time distribution for Omicron with a mean of 1.5-3.2 days and a standard deviation of 1.3-4.6 days. This implied a transmission advantage for Omicron in this setting of 160%-210% compared to Delta. We found similar relative results using an estimate of the intrinsic generation time for Delta though all estimates increased in magnitude due to the longer assumed generation time. Conclusions We found that a reduction in the generation time of Omicron compared to Delta was able to explain the observed variation over time in the transmission advantage of the Omicron variant. However, this analysis cannot rule out the role of other factors such as differences in the populations the variants were mixing in, differences in immune escape between variants or bias due to using the test to test distribution as a proxy for the generation time distribution.",,,,L2016843082,10.1101/2022.01.08.22268920

We compared the effects of vari-ous spike (S) protein mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and its VOC on transmissibility, illness severity, hospitaliza-tion risk, fatality rate, immunological evasion, and vaccine efficacy in this review. We also looked into the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its VOC.",,,,L2017961797,10.53854/liim-3003-2
"Face masking and COVID-19: Potential effects of variolation on transmission dynamics","Levine Z., Earn D.J.D.","Journal of the Royal Society Interface (2022) 19:190 Article Number: 20210781. Date of Publication: 2022","2022","19","190",,,"2022","Face masks do not completely prevent transmission of respiratory infections, but masked individuals are likely to inhale fewer infectious particles. If smaller infectious doses tend to yield milder infections, yet ultimately induce similar levels of immunity, then masking could reduce the prevalence of severe disease even if the total number of infections is unaffected. It has been suggested that this effect of masking is analogous to the pre-vaccination practice of variolation for smallpox,whereby susceptible individuals were intentionally infected with small doses of live virus (and often acquired immunity without severe disease). We present a simple epidemiological model in which mask-induced variolation causes milder infections, potentially with lower transmission rate and/or different duration. We derive relationships between the effectiveness of mask-induced variolation and important epidemiological metrics (the basic reproduction number and initial epidemic growth rate, and the peak prevalence, attack rate and equilibrium prevalence of severe infections). We illustrate our results using parameter estimates for the original SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus, as well as the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants. Our results suggest that if variolation is a genuine side-effect of masking, then the importance of facemasks as a tool for reducing healthcare burdens fromCOVID-19may be under-appreciated.",,,35506215,L2018041505,10.1098/rsif.2021.0781

Date of Publication: 2022","2022","21","6","90","98","2022","Despite the decrease in the incidence rate, today the problem of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains relevant on a global scale. Among the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, the Omicron is currently dominant. The differentiating properties of the Omicron variant are a shorter incubation period (1-5 days), high contagiousness, and a relatively mild course of the disease, which is associated with the highest number of genome mutations among all SARS-CoV-2 variants. The new variant is characterized by upper respiratory tract symptoms: rhinorrhea, severe sore throat, sneezing, less commonly cough, headache, and weakness. Oral antiviral drugs Paxlovid and Molnupiravir are effective for treating mild to moderate COVID-19, including in outpatients. While corticosteroids and interleukin-6 receptor antagonists are still effective in treating patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the effectiveness of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies has not yet been fully proven. Vaccination, especially booster doses, against SARS-CoV-2 is the most effective method of preventing COVID-19. The review purpose was to analyze the literature to determine the key aspects of prevention, clinical picture and treatment of a new SARSCoV-2 Omicron variant. The work used publications for the period from November 2021 to February 25, 2022, dedicated to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant from the following databases: PubMed, eLibrary, MedRxiv, Google Scholar. The following key words were used: “Omicron”, “SARSCoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “Omicron treatment”. The analysis showed that COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant is characterized by a relatively mild course. However, due to high contagiousness, this variant poses a significant problem due to the excessive load on outpatient and inpatient healthcare, including intensive care units.",,,,L2019509003,10.15829/1728-8800-2022-3228

Virus neutralization assays represent the gold standard for assessing antibody-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2 in sera from recovered and/or vaccinated individuals. Neutralizing antibodies block the interaction of viral spike protein with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in vitro and prevent viral entry into host cells. Classical viral neutralization assays using full replication-competent viruses are restricted to specific biosafety level 3-certified laboratories, limiting their utility for routine and large-scale applications. We developed therefore a cell-fusion-based assay building on the interaction between viral spike and ACE2 receptor expressed on two different cell lines, substantially reducing biosafety risks associated with classical viral neutralization assays. This chapter describes this simple, sensitive, safe and cost-effective approach for rapid and high-throughput evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies relying on high-affinity NanoLuc® luciferase complementation technology (HiBiT). When applied to a variety of standards and patient samples, this method yields highly reproducible results in 96-well, as well as in 384-well format. The use of novel NanoLuc® substrates with increased signal stability like Nano-Glo® Endurazine™ furthermore allows for high flexibility in assay set-up and full automatization of all reading processes. Lastly, the assay is suitable to evaluate the neutralizing capacity of sera against the existing spike variants, and potentially variants that will emerge in the future.",,,36220277,L2020140735,10.1016/bs.mie.2022.07.015

New subvariants with further mutations in their spike proteins are continuously emerging. Compared with the wild type and other variants of concern, Omicron variant exhibits altered etiological and epidemiological characteristics, with weakened pathogenicity and toxicity in laboratory mice and hamsters as well as enhanced immune escape capacity. The human infections are more likely to be asymptomatic and mild characterized by upper respiratory tract symptoms with reduced risk of hospitalization and death. In addition, Omicron variant can transmit more rapidly and shows shorter incubation period to cause infection, and the variant is more likely to transmit through contamination of object surfaces and aerosols spread.

Methods The data of daily confirmed cases of Omicron variant infection from April 8 to May 8, 2022 in two COVID-19 outbreaks in Guangzhou were collected for model fitting. Weibull, Gamma and lognormal distribution were used to estimate incubation period and serial interval. Exponential growth method and the maximum likelihood estimation were used to estimate R(0). Results The median of incubation period was 2.94 (95%CI: 2.52-3.38) days and median of serial interval was 3.32 (95%CI: 2.89-3.81) days. The estimated R(0) in small-size place was 4.40 (95%CI: 3.95-4.85), while the estimated R(0) at airport was 11.35 (95%CI: 11.02-11.67). Conclusion The incubation period of Omicron variant in two local COVID-19 outbreaks in Guangzhou is significantly shorter than that of delta variant. The higher the gathering degree in a place, the larger the R(0). Due to its rapid transmission, COVID-19 epidemic is prone to occur. Therefore, the COVID-19 prevention and control strategy should be dynamically adjusted in time.",,,36444451,L2021708568,10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20220523-00450

Date of Publication: 2022","2022","46","3","S130",,"2022","Introduction Cellular immunity is pivotal for SARS-CoV-2 protection, but measurements of cellular-specific response are rarely performed due to costs and technical requirements. Hyris developed a direct Real-Time PCR (dRT-PCR) assay that measures CD4 and CD8 T cells immunoreactive to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by targeting CXCL10 mRNA (upregulated in response to IFN-γ secreted by antigenspecific T Cell). This test uses a modular T cell activation method based on pool of synthetic peptides to stimulate Sspecific T cell, and those able to tolerate amino acid (AA) mutations that characterize new variants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the assay performances. Methods Whole blood (Li-He) of 13 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 116 vaccinated individuals were stimulated with a pool of Speptides (15 AA long) covering whole S protein (Wuhan) and left unstimulated (SCV2 T Activation kit). Whole blood of 78 healthy vaccinated individuals was stimulated with two sets of peptides covering the constant and mutated region of S protein of Omicron BA1.2 (SCV2 Omicron T Activation kit) and left unstimulated. After overnight incubation T cell activation was detected by bKIT dqTACT MS (CXCL10 and ACTIN mRNA) on the HYRIS bCUBE. Results The vaccinated subjects statistically shown level of relative mRNA expression of CXCL10 greater than unvaccinated subjects; 109 vaccinated individuals were detected as reactive to stimulation (mean relative expression 0.043) with SARS-CoV-2 S peptides (Sensitivity 94%), while 10 naïve were detected as not-reactive (mean expression -0.25) (Specificity 77%). Considering the 129 samples the AUC value of is 90% (CI 82%-98%). 78 samples activated with the constant and mutated region of S of Omicron peptides showed different quantities of T cells response. The 62% of sample assessed resulted reactive (with a ratio between the two stimulations above 15%) despite the AA mutations, showing that AA mutations can affect the magnitude of S T cell response. Conclusions Combining the modular utilization of synthetic peptide pools as activators and the direct measurement of CXCL10 mRNA in whole blood, dRT-PCR method was proven to be a reliable and efficient assay for the measurement of the individual antigen-specific T cells measurement of SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity.",,,,L639862318,

On 7 April 2022, an epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (BA.2) variant broke out in Guangzhou, China, one of the largest transportation and logistical hubs of the country. Methods: To fast curtained the Omicron epidemic, based on the routine surveillance on the risk population of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identify key places of the epidemic and implement enhanced control measures against Omicron. Results: Transmission characteristics of the Omicron variant were analyzed for 273 confirmed cases, and key places involved in this epidemic were fully presented. The median incubation time and the generation time were 3 days, and the reproduction number Rt was sharply increased with a peak of 4.20 within 2 days. We tried an all-out effort to tackle the epidemic in key places, and the proportion of confirmed cases increased from 61.17% at Stage 2 to 88.89% at Stage 4. Through delimited risk area management, 99 cases were found, and the cases were isolated in advance for 2.61 ± 2.76 days in a lockdown zone, 0.44 ± 1.08 days in a controlled zone, and 0.27 ± 0.62 days in a precautionary zone. People assigned with yellow code accounted for 30.32% (84/277) of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 83.33% of them were detected positive over 3 days since code assignment. For the districts outside the epicenter, the implementation duration of NPIs was much shorter compared with the Delta epidemic last year. Conclusion: By blocking out transmission risks and adjusting measures to local epidemic conditions through the all-out effort to tackle the epidemic in key places, by delimiting risk area management, and by conducting health code management of the at-risk population, the Omicron epidemic could be contained quickly.",,,36620243,L639995667,10.3389/fpubh.2022.979063
