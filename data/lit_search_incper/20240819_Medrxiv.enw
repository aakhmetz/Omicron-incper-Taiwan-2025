%X For the first several years of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance relied almost entirely on residual diagnostic specimens from nucleic acid amplification-based tests (NAATs). The use of NAATs waned after the end of the Stafford Act Emergency Declaration for COVID-19 in the US. To continue to monitor the spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we partnered with local- and state-level public health agencies and the Dane County Public Library System to obtain SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from freely available community rapid antigen tests (RATs). From August 15, 2023 to February 29, 2024 we received 227 tests through this system, from which we generated 127 sequences with &gt;10x depth of coverage for ≥90% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our results demonstrate that collecting and sequencing from RATs in partnership with trusted community stakeholders is a practical, useful approach for sustaining genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services [435100-A24-ELCProjE] and the CDC [75D30122C15355].Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The University of Wisconsin IRB determined that this human research was exempt because partici-pants were anonymous and self-identified.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Early diagnosis of active viral co-infections of similar symptomatic pattern is critical for preventing life-threatening respiratory complications. While facilities for the same are currently available, those are either over-expensive or not amenable for deployment in resource-limited settings. We report a first of its kind isothermal colorimetric nucleic acid-based test integrated in a user-friendly, portable device, that can differentially diagnose respiratory viral infections having similar symptomatic pattern, and illustrate its performance by detecting co-infections of SARS-CoV-2 with seasonal influenza A virus from unprocessed swab sample in an extraction-free analysis mode within 45 minutes without intermediate manual steps. The test obviates the need of any complex disposable cartridge in preference to common laboratory utilities. Further, it harnesses machine learning empowered and smartphone interfaced colorimetric analysis without needing any specialized optical detector. The efficacy of the test is validated via community-adapted randomized field trials at underserved rural settings by frontline health workers, reporting sensitivity &gt;96% and specificity &gt; 98% in 1500 cohorts. The method in the form of three test genes with one internal control assay evidences to facilitate viral surveillance and enables diagnosing complex respiratory infections early enough in a plethora of settings ranging from general hospitals to the community centres, overcoming barriers to access of high-end facilities. Such adaptation of scientifically supreme multiplex nucleic acid based diagnostics in the framework of a simple and user friendly rapid test appears to be the future of infectious disease management in a democratized framework, eradicating the disparities in affordability and accessibility in resource-limited settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementS.C. acknowledges the DSIR, Government of India, for financial support through the CRTDH Project on Affordable Healthcare.

%X Background The emergence of the hypermutated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) BA.2.86 variant raises significant concerns due to its potential to evade pre-existing immunity.Methods We measured cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses to BA.2.86 in 52 previously exposed participants and investigated clinic-demographic and viral genetic determinants affecting T-cell responses.Findings We found that despite notable escape from neutralizing antibodies, T-cell responses remained generally preserved, albeit with a significant but small loss in T-cell cross-recognition (7·5 %, 14·2 % and 10·8 % average loss for IFN-γ, IL-2 and IFN-γ + IL-2, respectively, p &lt; 0·05). This is consistent with the prediction of 6 out of 10 immunodominant T-cell epitopes (TCEs) altered by BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutations to have reduced peptide presentation. This effect is expected to be mitigated due to total TCEs across the genome. Remarkably, T-cell responses and cross-recognition were 3·5 (IFN-γ), 2 (IL-2) and 2·4 (IFN-γ + IL-2) times higher when first induced by natural infection rather than vaccination three years before, by increasing number of infections, and by ancestral/Delta than Omicron infections.Interpretation Our findings underscore the critical role and the factors influencing T-cell immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as first antigen encounter (vaccination or infection), which is essential for developing effective control strategies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.Funding European Union (Horizon Europe), Fundació Privada Daniel Bravo Andreu, Catalan Government (PERIS, CERCA), Spanish Ministry of Science, Rosetrees Trust, Pears Foundation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors declare no competing interests.

%X As wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) broadens its focus to include prevalent diseases with significant global health impact, existing surveillance systems concentrate on sewer-based infrastructure, which excludes the 2.7 billion people using non-sewered systems. To address this gap, our study explores the potential of fecal sludge treatment plants (FSTPs) for WBE, emphasizing the stability of virus RNA targets within pooled fecal sludge. We screened fecal sludge from a centralized treatment facility in Dakar, Senegal for SARS-CoV-2, human norovirus (HuNoV), and microbial source trackers (MSTs) pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV). Decay kinetics of genomic RNA markers from these viruses were examined at 4 °C, 15 °C, and 30 °C over 70 days. Results indicate high persistence of viral targets in fecal sludge (T90 value of 3.3 months for exogenous SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2, 6.2 months for ToBRFV), with all targets detected throughout the 70-day experiment under various temperatures with limited decay (&lt;1 log10 reduction). This study addresses a crucial gap in understanding virus persistence in on-site sanitation systems by providing essential decay rate constants for effective target detection. Our results indicate that sampling at centralized facilities treating fecal sludge from on-site sanitation could facilitate localized pathogen surveillance in low-income settings.HighlightsInvestigation of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2, HuNoV, PMMoV, and ToBRFV genomic RNA in pooled fecal sludge derived from on-site sanitation systems.Novel microbial source tracker (MST), ToBRFV, exhibited comparable abundance to PMMoV, a well-established MST, in fecal sludge.No significant decay observed for HuNoV and PMMoV over 70 days at all temperature conditions (4, 15, and 30 °C).SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 showed T90 values of 3.3 months at 30 °C.Fecal sludge treatment plants offer a centralized sampling location for wastewater-based epidemiology, providing a strategic approach for monitoring public health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFinancial support for this study was generously provided by the Stanford Diversifying Academia, Recruiting Excellence (DARE) Fellowship awarded to LMG, as well as grants from the Stanford School of Engineering, the Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health (CIGH), and the Stanford Department of Chemical Engineering.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Immunological memory to vaccination and viral infection involves coordinated action of B and T-cells, thus integrated analysis of these two components is critical for understanding their contributions to protection against breakthrough infections (BI). We investigated cellular and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination in participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The magnitude of antibody and T-cell responses following the second vaccine dose was associated with protection against BI in participants with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (cases), but not in infection-naïve controls. Youden’s index thresholds for protection against BI were calculated for all immune measures. Anti-Spike IgG (&gt;666.4 BAU/mL) and anti-Nucleocapsid pan Ig (&gt;0.1332 BAU/mL) thresholds combined were 100% specific and 83.3% sensitive for cases without BI over 8-months follow-up. Collectively these results point to the superior protective effect of hybrid immunity and have implications for the design of next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.Competing Interest StatementAF was a lead investigator on trials of COVID-19 vaccines funded by Oxford/Astra-Zeneca, Valneva and Sanofi and the UK government.

%T Genomic epidemiology reveals 2022 mpox epidemic in New York City governed by heavy-tailed sexual contact networks

%X The global mpox epidemic in 2022 was likely caused by transmission of mpox virus (MPXV) through sexual contact networks, with New York City (NYC) experiencing the first and largest outbreak in the United States. By performing a phylogeographic and epidemiological analysis of MPXV, we identify at least 200 introductions of MPXV into NYC and 84 leading to onward transmission. Through a comparative analysis with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in NYC, we find that both MPXV and HIV genomic cluster sizes are best fit by scale-free distributions and that people in MPXV clusters are more likely to have previously received an HIV diagnosis (odds ratio=1.58; p=0.012) and be a member of a recently growing HIV transmission cluster, indicating overlapping sexual contact networks. We then model the transmission of MPXV through sexual contact networks and show that highly connected individuals would be disproportionately infected at the start of an epidemic, thereby likely resulting in the exhaustion of the most densely connected parts of the sexual network. This dynamic explains the rapid expansion and decline of the NYC outbreak, as well as the estimated cumulative incidence of less than 2% within high-risk populations. By synthesizing the genomic epidemiology of MPXV and HIV with epidemic modeling, we demonstrate that MPXV transmission dynamics can be understood by general principles of sexually transmitted pathogens.Competing Interest StatementJ.O.W. receives contracts through his institution from the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention related to HIV public health surveillance.

%T A Machine Learning-enabled SIR Model for Adaptive and Dynamic Forecasting of COVID-19

%X The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to public health systems worldwide, necessitating accurate and adaptable forecasting models to manage and mitigate its impacts. This study presents a novel forecasting framework based on a Machine Learning-enabled Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (ML-SIR) model with time-varying parameters to predict COVID-19 dynamics across multiple geographies. The model incorporates emergent patterns from reported time-series data to estimate new hospitalisations, hospitalised patients, and new deaths. Our framework adapts to the evolving nature of the pandemic by dynamically adjusting the infection rate parameter over time and using a Fourier series to capture oscillating patterns in the data. This approach improves upon traditional SIR and forecasting models, which often fail to account for the complex and shifting dynamics of COVID-19 due to new variants, changing public health interventions, and varying levels of immunity. Validation of the model was conducted using historical data from the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan. The model’s performance was evaluated based on the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Absolute Percentage Error of Cumulative values (CAPE) for three-month forecast horizons. Results indicated that the model achieved an average MAPE of 32.5% for new hospitalisations, 34.4% for patients, and 34.8% for new deaths, for three-month forecasts. Notably, the model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to existing forecasting models with like-for-like disease metrics, countries and forecast horizons. The proposed ML-SIR model offers a robust and adaptable tool for forecasting COVID-19 dynamics, capable of adjusting to new time-series data and varying geographical contexts. This adaptability makes it suitable for localised hospital capacity planning, scenario modelling, and for application to other respiratory infectious diseases with similar transmission dynamics, such as influenza and RSV. By providing reliable forecasts, the model supports informed public health decision-making and resource allocation, enhancing preparedness and response efforts.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are current or previous employees of Airfinity Ltd.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any external fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirushttps://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4/about_dataI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Highly mutable pathogens generate viral diversity that impacts virulence, transmissibility, treatment, and thwarts acquired immunity. We previously described C19-SPAR-Seq, a high-throughput, next-generation sequencing platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 that we deployed to systematically profile variant dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 for over 3 years in a large, North American urban environment (Toronto, Canada). Sequencing of the ACE2 receptor binding motif and polybasic furin cleavage site of Spike in over 70,000 patients revealed that population sweeps of canonical variants of concern (VOCs) occurred in repeating wavelets. Furthermore, we found that subvariants and putative quasi-species with alterations characteristic of future VOCs and/or predicted to be functionally important arose frequently, but always extinguished. Systematic screening of functionally relevant domains in pathogens could thus provide a powerful tool for monitoring spread and mutational trajectories, particularly those with zoonotic potential.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Grant #177705)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board in Toronto, Canada gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines are an exciting but new technology used in humans. There is limited understanding of factors that influence their biodistribution and immunogenicity. Antibodies to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, are detectable in humans and boosted by human mRNA vaccination. We hypothesized that PEG-specific antibodies could increase the clearance of mRNA vaccines. We developed methods to quantify both the mRNA and ionizable lipid in frequent serial blood samples from 19 subjects receiving Moderna SPIKEVAX mRNA booster immunization. Both the mRNA and ionizable lipid peaked in blood 1-2 days post vaccination (median peak level 0.19 and 3.22 ng mL-1, respectively). The mRNA was detectable out to 14-28 days post-vaccination in most subjects. We measured the proportion of mRNA that was relatively intact in blood over time and found the decay kinetics of the intact mRNA and ionizable lipid were identical, suggesting the intact lipid nanoparticle recirculates in blood. However, mRNA and ionizable lipid decay rates did not correlate with baseline levels of PEG-specific nor spike-specific antibodies. The magnitude of mRNA and ionizable lipid detected in blood did correlate with the boost in PEG antibodies. Further, the ability of subject’s monocytes to phagocytose lipid nanoparticles had an inverse relationship with the rise in PEG antibodies. This suggests circulation of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines into the blood and their ability to be cleared by phagocytes influence PEG immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. Overall, this work defines the pharmacokinetics of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccine components in human blood after intramuscular injection and the factors that influence this. These insights should prove useful in improving the future safety and efficacy of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project (DP210103114 to FC, SJK and YJ), the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) program grant (GNT1149990 to SJK and MPD), the Victorian Critical Vaccinees Collection COVID-19 Research Seed Funding Grant (YJ), an ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DE230101542 to YJ), and NHMRC Investigator grants (SJK, WSL, GNT2016732 to FC, JAJ, AKW, and MPD).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocols were approved by the University of Melbourne human research and ethics committee (approvals #2056689), and all associated procedures were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.

%X Neutralizing antibody titer elicited through infection or vaccination is accepted as a reliable surrogate for protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and mortality. The gold standard for measuring neutralizing antibody levels relies on culturing live virus in the presence of a target cell and quantitating the level where 50% of the target cells are infected. These assays have numerous technical challenges, not the least is the requirement for a BSL-3 laboratory to perform the live virus testing. We developed the Q-NAb IgG Test for the quantitative determination of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants, traceable to WHO International Standards. The test utilizes a novel Fusion Protein that mimics the Spike receptor binding domain docked to the human ACE2 protein and effectively blocks non-neutralizing antibodies in the sample. After pre-blocking sequesters the non-neutralizing antibodies from the samples, direct binding of the residual neutralizing antibodies to variant RBDs coated in the wells of the microtiter plate is measured with a fluorescent secondary antibody. Results of the Q-NAb IgG Test agree with a live virus Microneutralization Assay for both the Ancestral strain (WA1-2020) and the Omicron BA.5 (COR-22-063113/2022) variant (Spearman’s correlation, ρ = 0.87 and 0.92, respectively). The analytical performance (LoB, LoD, LoQ, linearity, precision, and interference) of the Q-NAb IgG Test was established along with sensitivity and specificity using a panel of monoclonal neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Clinical sensitivity and specificity using pre-pandemic, convalescent, and vaccinated serum and plasma samples is also reported. The advantages of the Q-NAb IgG Test are its strong correlation to live virus neutralization tests, traceability to WHO International Standards, convenient microtiter plate format, low sample volume requirements, and suitability for a BSL-2 laboratory.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:WCG IRB gave ethical approval for collection of samples used in this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Detection and diagnosis of bloodborne pathogens are critical for patients and for preventing outbreaks, yet challenging due to these diseases’ nonspecific initial symptoms. We advanced CRISPR-based Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN) technology for simultaneous detection of pathogens on numerous samples. We developed three specialized panels that target viral hemorrhagic fevers, mosquito-borne viruses, and sexually transmitted infections, collectively identifying 23 pathogens. We used deep learning to design CARMEN assays with enhanced sensitivity and specificity, validating them and evaluating their performance on synthetic targets, spiked healthy normal serum samples, and patient samples for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States and for Lassa and mpox virus in Nigeria. Our results show multiplexed CARMEN assays match or outperform individual assay RT-PCR in sensitivity, with matched specificity. These findings underscore CARMEN’s potential as a highly effective tool for rapid, accurate pathogen detection for clinical diagnosis and public health surveillance.Competing Interest StatementN.L.W., and P.C.S. are coinventors on a patent related to this work.

%X Estimating epidemiological parameters is essential for informing an effective public health response during waves of infectious disease transmission. However, many parameters are challenging to estimate from real-world data, and rely on human challenge studies or mass community testing. During Winter 2023/2024, a community cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted across households in England and Scotland. From this survey, questionnaire data and follow-up testing protocols provided valuable data into multiple epidemiological parameters: namely, the duration of positivity, test sensitivity, and the incubation period. Here, Bayesian statistical modelling methods are developed and applied to estimate the underlying parameters. The duration of LFD positivity is found to increase with increasing age, with a mean of 8.55 days (95% CrI: 7.65 days, 9.44 days) in the youngest age group compared to 10.27 days (95% CrI: 9.85 days, 10.71 days) in the oldest age group. Similarly, test sensitivity, as a function of time since symptom onset, decays fastest in the youngest age group, reaching a minimum sensitivity of 0.26 (95% CrI: 0.16, 0.37) compared to 0.54 (95% CrI: 0.46, 0.6). Such patterns are expected since younger individuals experience less severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are likely to clear the virus faster. Combining the duration of positivity and test sensitivity, we estimate the probability of returning a positive test. Close to symptom onset date, this probability is approximately 95%. However, this rapidly drops off, dropping below 5% after 11.3 days (95% CrI: 9.7 days, 13 days) for the youngest age group and 16.2 days (95% CrI: 15.4 days, 17.1 days) for the oldest age group. For the incubation period, there is no clear pattern by age. Across all age groups, the mean incubation period is 2.52 days (95% CrI: 2.42 days, 2.62 days). This is shorter than the most recent estimates for Omicron BA.5, which is in line with earlier research that found replacing variants had shorter incubation periods.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThere was no financial support for this work, completed as part of the authors employment.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:National Statisticians Data Ethics Advisory Committee of UK Statistics Authority gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 household transmission dynamics guides infection control and vaccination measures. This household cohort study prospectively assessed the impact of both the Omicron BA.2 variant and immunity on household transmission using dense saliva sampling and sequence analysis.Methods Households consisting of a PCR-confirmed index and at least two household members were enrolled in March and April 2022 during the Omicron BA.2 wave in the Netherlands. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed on ten consecutive saliva samples. Serum-antibodies were measured at baseline and day 42. Whole genome sequencing was performed for phylogenetic analysis, followed by sensitivity analysis, to correct for multiple household introductions and index definition. Results were compared with the identical, early-pandemic and pre- immunisation predecessor study.Results Sixty-seven households were included, consisting of 241 individuals (median age 33.0 years). Maximum household Secondary Attack Rate (SAR) was 59.7%, per-person SAR 41.5%. Underage indexes were more likely to transmit. Transmission was negatively affected by household members’ immunity. Phylogenetic analysis showed multiple introductions in four households. Sensitivity analysis resulted in a minimal household SAR of 51.0% and per-person SAR of 28.5%.Conclusions The Omicron BA.2 variant is highly transmissible within households. Nevertheless, transmission rates are lower than our pre-immunisation reported ancestral rates: household SAR decreased from 88.2% to 59.7%, per-person SAR from 64.3% to 41.5%, implying immunity reduces transmission, even for a more transmittable variant. Regardless of immune status, children have a crucial role in Omicron household transmission. Intensive sampling and phylogenetic analysis are essential to correctly calculate transmission rate, especially in times of minimal behavioural restrictions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All participants provided written informed consent.

%X Background Severe COVID and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) are characterized by excessive inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In adults, disease severity is associated with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG Fc afucosylation, which induces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from innate immune cells. This study aimed to define spike IgG Fc glycosylation following SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults and children and following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in adults and the relationships between glycan modifications and cytokine/chemokine levels.Methods We analyzed longitudinal (n=146) and cross-sectional (n=49) serum/plasma samples from adult and pediatric COVID patients, MIS-C patients, adult vaccinees, and adult and pediatric healthy controls. We developed methods for characterizing bulk and spike IgG Fc glycosylation by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and measured levels of ten inflammatory cytokines/chemokines by multiplexed ELISA.Results Spike IgG were more afucosylated than bulk IgG during acute adult COVID and MIS-C. We observed an opposite trend following vaccination, but it was not significant. Spike IgG were more galactosylated and sialylated and less bisected than bulk IgG during adult COVID, with similar trends observed during pediatric COVID/MIS-C and following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Spike IgG glycosylation changed with time following adult COVID or vaccination. Afucosylated spike IgG exhibited inverse and positive correlations with inflammatory markers in MIS-C and following vaccination, respectively; galactosylated and sialylated spike IgG inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines in adult COVID and MIS-C; and bisected spike IgG positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in multiple groups.Conclusions We identified previously undescribed relationships between spike IgG glycan modifications and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines that expand our understanding of IgG glycosylation changes that may impact COVID and MIS-C immunopathology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, under award number UM1AI148684 as an IDCRC Early Career Investigator Pilot Award to Erin M.

%X To understand the transmissibility and spread of infectious diseases, epidemiologists turn to estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number. While many estimation approaches exist, their utility may be limited. Challenges of surveillance data collection, model assumptions that are unverifiable with data alone, and computationally inefficient frameworks are critical limitations for many existing approaches. We propose a discrete spline-based approach that solves a convex optimization problem—Poisson trend filtering—using the proximal Newton method. It produces a locally adaptive estimator for instantaneous reproduction number estimation with heterogeneous smoothness. Our methodology remains accurate even under some process misspecifications and is computationally efficient, even for large-scale data. The implementation is easily accessible in a lightweight R package rtestim.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementDaniel J.

%X Despite the appeal of screening travelers during emerging infectious disease outbreaks, evidence shows that syndromic and questionnaire-based programs are largely ineffective in preventing or delaying the geographic spread of infection. Molecular tests offer high sensitivity and specificity, and can detect infections earlier than symptom screening, suggesting potential for improved outcomes, yet molecular tests were used to screen travelers for COVID-19 with mixed success. To investigate why screening for COVID-19 was not more successful, and to quantify the limits of screening for other pathogens of concern, we developed a probabilistic model that incorporates within-host viral kinetics. We then evaluated the potential effectiveness of screening travelers with molecular tests for influenza A, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Ebola virus. Even under highly optimistic assumptions about behavior and test characteristics, we find screening effectiveness is always limited because the infections with the highest transmission potential are undetectable at the time of travel, an idea we term the fundamental limit of traveler screening. We also demonstrate how estimates of ascertainment are a misleading substitute for screening effectiveness because they overestimate reductions in transmission at the destination. Understanding these limitations can guide the deployment of future traveler screening programs and inform strategies to improve outbreak prevention and control.Competing Interest StatementD.B.L. is a member of the scientific advisory board of Darwin BioSciences.

%X Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) infection (PASC) is a heterogeneous condition, but the main viral drivers are unknown. Here, we use MENSA, Media Enriched with Newly Synthesized Antibodies, secreted exclusively from circulating human plasmablasts, to provide an immune snapshot that defines the underlying viral triggers. We provide proof-of-concept testing that the MENSA technology can capture the new host immune response to accurately diagnose acute primary and breakthrough infections when known SARS2 virus or proteins are present. It is also positive after vaccination when spike proteins elicit an acute immune response. Applying the same principles for long-COVID patients, MENSA is positive for SARS2 in 40% of PASC vs none of the COVID recovered (CR) patients without any sequelae demonstrating ongoing SARS2 viral inflammation only in PASC. Additionally, in PASC patients, MENSAs are also positive for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in 37%, Human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 23%, and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) in 15% compared to 17%, 4%, and 4% in CR controls respectively. Combined, a total of 60% of PASC patients have a positive MENSA for SARS2, EBV, CMV, and/or HSV2. MENSA offers a unique antibody snapshot to reveal the underlying viral drivers in long-COVID thus demonstrating the persistence of SARS2 and reactivation of viral herpes in 60% of PASC patients.Graphical abstract Competing Interest StatementFEL is the founder of MicroB-plex, Inc. and serves on the scientific board of Be Biopharma, is a recipient of grants from the BMGF and Genentech, Inc., and has served as a consultant for Astra Zeneca.

%X Introduction Differences in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic among Northwestern European countries have generated extensive discussion. We explore how the impact of the first pandemic wave might have differed, had Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom adopted responses from the other countries, or had it delayed its own response.Methods The time-varying reproduction number Rt for each country was estimated using time-series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Counterfactual assessment of the impact of responses was conducted by interchanging the reduction in reproduction number by calendar date between countries from March 13th to July 1st, 2020. The impact of a delayed response was evaluated by lagging the time-series of the reproduction number with one day or three days.Results The cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths for any of the six countries would have differed substantially, had the response of another country been adopted on the respective calendar date. The order, from the lowest to the highest expected mortality rate, was obtained with the responses of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Sweden, with a seven- to twelve-fold difference between the lowest and highest outcome. For the Netherlands, delaying its response by three days resulted in a doubling of the cumulative COVID-19 mortality rate.Conclusion During the fast-growing first COVID-19 wave, small differences in initial epidemiological situations between countries, together with small differences in the timing and effectiveness of adopting COVID-19 response from neighboring countries, result in large variations in mortality rates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was financed by the Netherlands Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, and the European Union's Horizon research and innovation program - project ESCAPE (grant agreement number 101095619).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%T Early and accurate prediction of COVID-19 hospitalization risk and symptomatic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection

%X Background Whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection has become endemic, COVID-19 related hospitalization and mortality are still considerably high. Both anti-viral and immune modulating therapies against COVID-19 are available, but they must be initiated early after infection and given only to patients of need. Currently, patients’ demographics and clinical pre-conditions factors are used to determine treatment eligibility. However, the latter do not provide accurate prediction and there are no useful biomarkers for early accurate prediction of COVID-19 related hospitalization risk and disease progression.Methods Non-vaccinated patients (N=185) were recruited early after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Biochemistry, hematology and 8 serum cytokine levels were longitudinally measured within the first month.Findings Early levels of LDH, IL-6 or CRP, each alone or their combinations, were identified as accurate predictors for the risk of hospitalization (sensitivity=93.6-100%, specificity=93.4-96.7%, p&lt;0.0001). Moreover, the combination of 4 cytokines (IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17A) was the only accurate predictor for symptoms risk (sensitivity=97.5%, specificity=92.3%, p&lt;0.0001). In comparison, age and BMI showed significantly lower predictive values than above biomarkers. Prediction with above biomarkers was independent of sampling time (0-11 days post symptoms onset), age, gender, BMI, clinical pre-conditions or SARS-CoV-2 variant. Furthermore, the early higher levels of LDH, CRP and inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized, as compared to non-hospitalized, patients, stayed consistently higher for at least 4 weeks.Interpretation The risk for COVID-19 hospitalization or symptoms can be accurately predicted as early as the time of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with biomarkers that are feasibly measurable at point-of-testing. These findings could allow for better early personalized treatment and optimization of clinical management of COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art Program for the funding of Corona research (Early-Opt-COVID19 project and research networks FOR-COVID and Bay-VOC), by grants from the Helmholtz Association Initiative and Networking Fund (KA1-Co-02 COVIPA to UP; KA1-Co-06 CORAERO to CH, MG and AUN), by the European Commission FET Open Grant VIROFIGHT (grant no. 899619), and by the Sanddorf foundation.

%X Increased immune evasion by emerging and highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants is a key challenge to the control of COVID-19. The majority of these mutations mainly target the spike protein, allowing the new variants to escape the immunity previously raised by vaccination and/or infection by earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigated the neutralizing capacity of antibodies against emerging variants of interest circulating between May 2023 and March 2024 using sera from representative samples of the Kenyan population. From our genomics data, we identified the most prevalent Kenyan and global variants and performed pseudoviruses neutralization assays with the most recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our data show that antibodies from individuals in the general population in Kenya were less effective against the recent prevalent SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants (i.e. EG.5.1, FY.4, BA.2.86, JN.1, and JN.1.4) compared to the ancestral wildtype strain. Although there was increased neutralization following multiple doses of vaccine, antibodies from &gt;40% of the vaccinated individuals did not neutralize the omicron variants, suggesting that individuals were susceptible to infection by these variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Wellcome Trust (grants 226141/Z/22/Z, 226130/Z/22/Z, 227131/Z/23/Z &amp; 227131/B/23/Z 226141/Z/22/Z and 226002/A/22/Z), MRC (MR/W005611/1, MR/Y004205/1), BBSRC (BBS/E/I/COV07001, BBS/E/I/00007031), and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-039626).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Kenya Medical Research Institute, Scientific Ethics Review Unit gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X We investigated the impact of antiviral treatment on the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 resistance during persistent infections in immunocompromised patients (n=15). All patients received remdesivir and some also received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or monoclonal antibodies. Sequence analysis showed that nine patients carried viruses with mutations in the nsp12 (RNA dependent RNA polymerase), while four had viruses with nsp5 (3C protease) mutations. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 with a double mutation in nsp5 (T169I) and nsp12 (V792I) was recovered from respiratory secretions 77 days after initial COVID-19 diagnosis from a patient treated with remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. In vitro characterization confirmed its decreased sensitivity to remdesivir and nirmatrelvir, which was overcome by combined antiviral treatment. Studies in golden Syrian hamsters demonstrated efficient transmission to contact animals. This study documents the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 carrying resistance mutations to both nirmatrelvir and remdesivir from a patient and demonstrates its transmissibility in vivo.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSequencing was performed in part by the New York Genome Center (NYGC) Sequencing Laboratory as part of the COVID-19 Genomic Research Network (CGRN) with funds generously provided by NYGC donors and the JPB Foundation.

%X The current diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 rely on quantitative RT-PCR. However, the presence of viral RNA in samples does not necessarily reflect the presence of an infectious virus. Therefore, the reliable detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples is necessary to limit viral transmission. Here, we developed a flow cytometry-based surrogate assay (FlowSA), wherein the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was detected using virus nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. We showed that FlowSA allows the detection of a wide range of viral titers of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, the assay was successfully used to detect infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, including those with high Ct values.

%X Wastewater-based epidemiology aims at measuring pathogens in wastewater as a means of deriving unbiased epidemiological information at a population scale, ranging from buildings and aircrafts to entire cities or countries. After gaining significant mainstream attention during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the field holds significant promise as a continuous monitoring and early warning system tracking emerging viral variants or new pathogens with pandemic potential.To expand the current toolbox of analytical techniques for wastewater analysis, we explored the use of Hyperplex PCR (hpPCR) to analyse SARS-CoV-2 mutations in wastewater samples collected weekly in up to 22 sites across Sweden between October 2022 and December 2023. Approximately 900 samples were tested using a dynamic probe panel with a multiplexity ranging from 10-to 18-plex, continuously adapted within 1-2 weeks to quantify relevant mutations of concern over time. The panel simultaneously covered deletions, single nucleotide substitutions, as well as variable regions resorting to probe degeneracy. By analysing all samples in parallel resorting to gold standard methods including qPCR and two different NGS technologies, the performance of hpPCR is herein shown to bridge the gap between these methods by providing (1) systematic single nucleotide sensitivity with a simple probe design, (2) high multiplexity without panel re-optimization requirements and (3) 4-5-week earlier mutation detection compared to NGS with excellent quantitative linearity and a good correlation for mutation frequency (r=0.88). Based on the demonstrated performance, the authors propose the combined use of NGS and hpPCR for routine discovery and high-frequency monitoring of key pathogens/variants as a potential alternative to the current analysis paradigm.Competing Interest StatementU.N. and R.S. are co-inventors of the hpPCR methodology according to patent application WO/2021/206614.

%X Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for phylodynamic analysis, addressing common computational limitations affecting existing methods. However, notable disparities exist between simulated phylogenetic trees used for training existing deep learning models and those derived from real-world sequence data, necessitating a thorough examination of their practicality. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of model performance by assessing an existing deep learning inference tool for phylodynamics, PhyloDeep, against realistic phylogenetic trees characterized from SARS-CoV-2. Our study reveals the poor predictive accuracy of PhyloDeep models trained on simulated trees when applied to realistic data. Conversely, models trained on realistic trees demonstrate improved predictions, despite not being infallible, especially in scenarios where superspreading dynamics are challenging to capture accurately. Consequently, we find markedly improved performance through the integration of minimal contact tracing data. Applying this approach to a sample of SARS-CoV-2 sequences partially matched to contact tracing from Hong Kong yields informative estimates of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading potential beyond the scope of contact tracing data alone. Our findings demonstrate the potential for enhancing deep learning phylodynamic models processing low resolution trees through complementary data integration, ultimately increasing the precision of epidemiological predictions crucial for public health decision making and outbreak control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNational Institutes of Health contract number 75N93021C00016 (VD) Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR, China (Project No. [T11-705/21-N]) (VD) The Collaborative Research Scheme (Project No. C7123-20G) of the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (BC, DA) Health and Medical Research Fund Seed Grant Scheme (Project No. 22211192) of the Hong Kong SAR (DA) HKU-Pasteur Research Pole Fellowship 2023 (S-AC23005-01) (RX) PaRis AI Research InstitutE (PRAIRIE; ANR-19-P3IA-0001) (OG) Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease impacting millions across the globe. Nevertheless, akin to many other diseases, reports indicated a decline in dengue incidence and seroprevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-22). This presumably could be attributed to reduced treatment-seeking rates, under-reporting, misdiagnosis, disrupted health services and reduced exposure to vectors due to lockdowns. Scientific evidence on dengue virus (DENV) disease during the COVID-19 pandemic is limited globally.Methods A cross-sectional, randomized cluster sampling community-based survey was carried out to assess anti-dengue IgM and IgG and SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence across all 38 districts of Tamil Nadu, India. The prevalence of DENV in the Aedes mosquito pools during 2021 was analyzed and compared with previous and following years of vector surveillance for DENV by real-time PCR.Findings Results implicate that both DENV-IgM and IgG seroprevalence and mosquito viral positivity were reduced across all the districts. A total of 13464 mosquito pools and 5577 human serum samples from 186 clusters were collected. Of these, 3·76% of mosquito pools were positive for DENV. In the human sera, 4·12% were positive for DENV IgM and 6·4% were positive for DENV IgG. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres correlated with dengue seropositivity with a significant association whereas vaccination status significantly correlated with dengue IgM levels.Interpretation Continuous monitoring of DENV seroprevalence, especially with the evolving variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and surge in COVID-19 cases will shed light on the transmission and therapeutic attributes of dengue infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Health Mission, Tamil Nadu (680/NGS/NHMTNMSC/ENGG/2021) for the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (S.T.S. and S.R.).

%X Background People with HIV (PWH) often have a suboptimal response to vaccines, raising concerns about the efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in this population. We aimed to evaluate the humoral immune response to the B.1 lineage and Omicron variant in PWH following COVID-19 vaccination.Methods We conducted a prospective study on 19 PWH who received a two-dose series of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and a booster six months later. Participants without HIV infection were included as a healthy control (HC) group. The humoral response to the COVID-19 vaccine (anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG levels and ability to block ACE2-S interaction) against both the original B.1 lineage and the Omicron variant was measured by immunoassays.Results The humoral response in PWH was very strong (GMFR &gt;8) after the second dose and strong (GMFR &gt;4) after the booster dose for both the B.1 lineage and the Omicron variant. We found similar humoral responses to the B.1 lineage and Omicron variant between PWH and HC groups after the second and booster doses (q-value &gt;0.05). The COVID-19 vaccine generated a significantly weaker humoral response against the Omicron variant compared to the B.1 lineage in both groups (q-value &lt;0.05). However, this response improved after the booster dose, although the inhibition of ACE2-S interaction remained weaker in PWH.Conclusions PWH generated a strong humoral response to the COVID-19 vaccine against both the B.1 lineage and the Omicron variant, similar to individuals without HIV infection. However, our data suggest the need for booster doses to improve immunogenicity and update COVID-19 vaccines for new variants like Omicron.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by The Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red (CIBER) de Enfermedades Infecciosas (CB21/13/00044).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor (HUIL) gave ethical approval for this work (Ref.: 030-21)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Serum neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) induced by vaccination have been linked to protection against symptomatic COVID-19 and severe disease. However, much less is known about the efficacy of nAbs in preventing the acquisition of infection, especially in the context of natural immunity and against SARS-CoV-2 immune-escape variants. In this study, we conducted mediation analysis to assess serum nAbs induced by prior SARS-CoV-2 infections as potential correlates of protection (CoPs) against Delta and Omicron BA.1/2 wave infections, in rural and urban household cohorts in South Africa. We find that, in the Delta wave, anti-D614G nAbs mediate 37% (95%CI 34% – 40%) of the total protection against infection conferred by prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and that protection decreases with waning immunity. In contrast, anti-Omicron BA.1 nAbs mediate 11% (95%CI 9 – 12%) of the total protection against Omicron BA.1/2 wave infections, due to Omicron’s neutralization escape. These findings underscore that CoPs mediated through nAbs are variant-specific, and that boosting of nAbs against circulating variants might restore or confer immune protection lost due to nAb waning and/or immune escape. However, the majority of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 conferred by natural infection cannot be fully explained by serum nAbs alone. Measuring these and other immune markers including T-cell responses, both in the serum and in other compartments such as the nasal mucosa, may be required to comprehensively understand and predict immune protection against SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementCC has received grant support from Sanofi Pasteur, US CDC, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Taskforce for Global Health, Wellcome Trust and the South African Medical Research Council.

%X The effectiveness of antiviral treatment with remdesivir against COVID-19 has been investigated in clinical trials suggesting earlier recovery. However, this effect seems to be rather modest. In this study, we assessed the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 369 COVID-19 individuals across a spectrum of illness severities, including both untreated individuals and individuals who received antiviral treatment with remdesivir. Moreover, using a process-based mathematical model, we quantified and analyzed the within-host infection dynamics of 69 untreated and 19 antiviral-treated individuals. For untreated individuals, we found that those hospitalized exhibit significantly lower levels of early immune response and higher cumulative viral loads than those who were not. For treated individuals, we found that those who died were on average hospitalized later after symptom onset than those who survived, underscoring the importance of early medical intervention for severe COVID-19. Our model estimates a rather limited antiviral activity of remdesivir and, consequently, comparable viral load dynamics between individuals responding and not responding to antiviral treatment. Our results provide valuable insights into the clinical course of COVID-19 during antiviral treatment with remdesivir and suggest the need for alternative treatment regimens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Greece (84 / 09.12.2022), and was also approved by the Scientific Council of the public hospital from which the sample was derived (19535 / 28.06.2023).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Even within a single protein, antibody binding can have beneficial, neutral, or harmful effects during the response to infection. Resolving a polyclonal antibody repertoire across a pathogen’s proteome to specific epitopes may therefore explain much of the heterogeneity in susceptibility to infectious disease. However, the three-dimensional nature of antibody-epitope interactions makes the discovery of non-obvious targets challenging. We implemented a novel computational method and synthetic biology pipeline for identifying epitopes that are functionally important in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified an IgM-dominant response to an exposed Membrane protein epitope which to our knowledge is the strongest correlate of severe disease identified to date (adjusted OR 72.14, 95% CI: 9.71 – 1300.15), stronger even than the exponential association of severe disease with age. We also identify persistence (&gt; 2 years) of this IgM response in individuals with longCOVID, and a correlation with fatigue and depression symptom burden. The repetitive arrangement of this epitope and the pattern of isotype class switching is consistent with this being a previously unrecognized T independent antigen. These findings point to a coronavirus host-pathogen interaction characteristic of severe virus driven immune pathology. This epitope is a promising vaccine and therapeutic target as it is highly conserved through SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution in humans to date and in related coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV), showing far less evolutionary plasticity than targets on the Spike protein. This provides a promising biomarker for longCOVID and a target to complement Spike-directed vaccination which could broaden humoral protection from severe or persistent disease or novel coronavirus spillovers.One-Sentence Summary Using a novel protein-structure-based B cell epitope discovery method with a wide range of possible applications, we have identified a simple to measure host-pathogen antibody signature associated with severe COVID-19 and longCOVID and suggest the viral Membrane protein contains an epitope that acts as a T independent antigen during infection triggering extrafollicular B cell activation.Competing Interest StatementPKAK, DJK, JAM, and NG are inventors on a preliminary application for a patent filed 9th December 2021 by University of Edinburgh titled "Thermodynamic prediction, synthesis and prioritisation of immunogenic peptides" and have no other competing interests.

%X Background Population-level viral load distribution, measured by cycle threshold (Ct), has been demonstrated to enable real-time estimation of Rt for SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain. Generalisability of the framework under different circulating variants and pre-existing immunity remains unclear.Aim This study aimed to examine the impact of evolving variants and population immunity on the generalizability of Ct-based transmission estimation framework.Methods We obtained the first Ct record of local COVID-19 cases from July 2020 to January 2023 in Hong Kong. We modeled the association between daily viral load distribution and the conventional estimates of Rt based on case count. We trained the model using data from wave 3 (i.e., ancestral strain with minimal population immunity) and predicted Rt for wave 5, 6 and 7 (i.e., omicron subvariants with &gt; 70% vaccine coverage). Cross-validation was performed by training on the other 4 waves. Stratification analysis by disease severity was conducted to evaluate the impact of the changing severity profiles.Results Trained with the ancestral dominated wave 3, our model provided accurate estimation of Rt, with the area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.96, 1.00), 0.62 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.70) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.88) for three omicron dominated waves 5 to 7, respectively. Models trained on the other four waves also had high accuracy. Stratification analysis suggested potential impact of case severity on model estimation, which coincided with the fluctuation of sampling delay.Discussion Our findings suggested that incorporating population viral shedding can provide accurate real-time estimation of transmission with evolving variants and population immunity. Application of the model needs to account for sampling delay.Competing Interest StatementB.J.C. consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GSK, Haleon, Moderna, Roche, Sanofi Pasteur, and Pfizer.

%X COVID-19 disproportionately affected minorities, while research barriers to engage underserved communities persist. Serological studies reveal infection and vaccination histories within these communities, however lack of consensus on downstream evaluation methods impede meta-analyses and dampen the broader public health impact. To reveal the impact of COVID-19 and vaccine uptake among diverse communities and to develop rigorous serological downstream evaluation methods, we engaged racial and ethnic minorities in Massachusetts in a cross-sectional study (April - July 2022), screened blood and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 and human endemic coronavirus (hCoV) antibodies by bead-based multiplex assay and point-of-care (POC) test and developed across-plate normalization and classification boundary methods for optimal qualitative serological assessments. Among 290 participants, 91.4 % reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 41.7 % reported past SARS-CoV-2 infections, which was confirmed by POC- and multiplex-based saliva and blood IgG seroprevalences. We found significant differences in antigen-specific IgA and IgG antibody outcomes and indication of cross-reactivity with hCoV OC43. Finally, 26.5 % of participants reported lingering COVID-19 symptoms, mostly middle-aged Latinas. Hence, prolonged COVID-19 symptoms were common among our underserved population and require public health attention, despite high COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Saliva served as a less-invasive sample-type for IgG-based serosurveys and hCoV cross-reactivity needed to be evaluated for reliable SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey results. Using the developed rigorous downstream qualitative serological assessment methods will help standardize serosurvey outcomes and meta-analyses for future serosurveys beyond SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported through the National Institutes of Health, NCI Serological Sciences Network (U01 CA261276), UMass Chan COVID-19 pandemic research fund, MassCPR Evergrande Award, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, through Grant KL2-TR001455.

%X This study characterized antibody responses induced by COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection in saliva. Utilizing multiplex microsphere-based immunoassays, we measured saliva anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG, IgA, and secretory IgA in 1,224 saliva samples collected from healthcare workers in the Prospective Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion study between August of 2020 through December of 2022. By spring of 2022, most individuals had detectable spike-specific antibodies in saliva. Longitudinal measurements of saliva anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG revealed that most spike-specific IgA and secretory IgA detected in saliva was driven by subclinical and clinically-evident infections, rather than by vaccination alone. In contrast, saliva anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG was strongly induced by vaccination and exhibited improved durability with hybrid immunity. Baseline levels of saliva antibodies to the endemic human coronaviruses positively correlated with post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG levels. This study provides insights for development of vaccines that generate mucosal antibodies to respiratory pathogens.HIGHLIGHTS Saliva anti-spike antibodies were present in &gt; 90% of participants by spring 2022Saliva anti-spike IgA was driven by subclinical and clinically evident infectionsCOVID-19 mRNA vaccination alone was a weak inducer of saliva IgA antibodiesHCoV immunity correlates with post-vaccine anti-spike saliva antibody levelsCompeting Interest StatementS.P. and T.H.B. report that the USU IDCRP, a U.S. Department of Defense DoD Institution, and the HJF were funded under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to conduct an unrelated phase III COVID-19 monoclonal antibody immunoprophylaxis trial sponsored by AstraZeneca.

%X Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants are a continuous threat to human life and prosperity. An urgent need remains for simple and fast tests that reliably detect active infections with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers. Here we introduce a simple and rapid activity-based diagnostic (ABDx) test that identifies SARS-CoV-2 infections by measuring the activity of a viral enzyme, Papain-Like protease (PLpro). The test system consists of a peptide that fluoresces when cleaved by SARS PLpro that is active in crude, unprocessed lysates from human tongue scrapes and saliva. Test results are obtained in 30 minutes or less using widely available fluorescence plate readers, or a battery-operated portable instrument for testing at point of care (PoC) sites and in low-resource and hard to reach populations. Proof-of-concept was obtained in a clinical study on clinical specimens collected from patients with COVID-19 like symptoms who tested positive (n=10) or negative (n=10) with diagnostic LIAT RT-PCR using nasal mid turbinate swabs. When saliva from these patients was tested with in-house endpoint RT-PCR only 3 specimens were negative and 17 were positive. PLpro activity correlated in 17 of these cases (3 out of 3 negatives and 14 out of 16 positives, with one invalid specimen. Despite the small number of samples, the agreement was significant (p value = 0.01). In one presumptive false positive patient viral RNA was detected in saliva 5 days later by endpoint RT-PCR. Two false negatives were detected, one from a sample with a late Ct value of 35 in diagnostic RT-PCR, indicating that an active infection was no longer present. The PLpro activity assay is easily scalable and expected to detect all viable SARS-CoV-2 variants and recombinants, making it attractive as a screening and surveillance tool. Additionally, we show feasibility of the platform as a new homogeneous phenotypic assay for rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibodies.Competing Interest StatementMesa Photonics holds two utility patents covering diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 infections and antiviral screening based on PLpro activity, with FHR as inventor. The other authors declare no conflict of interest.Funding StatementThe research was funded by the Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency (SP4701-21-C-0054) to Mesa Photonics.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This project was approved by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Human Research Protection Program.

%X Background Covid-19 healthcare worker testing, isolation and quarantine policies had to balance risks to patients from the virus and from staff absence. The emergence of the Omicron variant led to dangerous levels of key-worker absence globally.We evaluated whether using two manufacturers’ lateral flow tests (LFTs) concurrently improved SARS-CoV-2 Omicron detection and was acceptable to hospital staff. In a nested study, to understand risks of return to work after a 5-day isolation/quarantine period, we examined virus culture 5-7 days after positive test or significant exposure.Methods Fully-vaccinated Liverpool (UK) University Hospitals staff participated (February-May 2022) in a random-order, open-label trial testing whether dual LFTs improved SARS-CoV2 detection, and whether dual swabbing was acceptable to users. Participants used nose-throat swab Innova and nose-only swab Orient Gene LFTs in daily randomised order for 10 days. A user-experience questionnaire was administered on exit. Selected participants gave swabs for viral culture on Days 5-7. Cultures were considered positive if cytopathic effect was apparent or SARs-COV2 N gene sub-genomic RNA was detected.Results 226 individuals reported 1466 pairs of LFT results. Tests disagreed in 127 cases (8.7%). Orient Gene was more likely (78 cf. 49, P=0.03) to be positive. Orient Gene positive Innova negative result-pairs became more frequent over time (P&lt;0.001). If Innova was swabbed second, it was less likely to agree with a positive Orient Gene result (P=0.005); swabbing first with Innova made no significant difference (P=0.85).Of 311 individuals completing the exit questionnaire, 90.7% reported dual swabbing was easy, 57.1% said it was no barrier to their daily routine and 65.6% preferred dual testing. Respondents had more confidence in dual c.f. single test results (P&lt;0.001).Viral cultures from Days 5-7 were positive for 6/31 (19.4%, 7.5%-37.5%) and indeterminate for 11/31 (35.5%, 19.2%-54.6%) LFT-positive participants, indicating they were likely still infectious.Conclusions Dual brand testing increased LFT detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen by a small but meaningful margin and was acceptable to hospital workers. Viral cultures demonstrated that policies recommending safe return to work ∼5 days after Omicron infection/exposure were flawed. Key-workers should be prepared for dynamic self-testing protocols in future pandemics.Trial registration https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN47058442 (IRAS:311842)Competing Interest StatementAll authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at https://www.icmje.org/disclosure-of-interest and declare: funding from the Department of Health and Social Care, Economic and Social Research Council, and National Institute for Health and Care Research; no support from any organisation for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.

%X In this phase III, open label, single arm, multicenter clinical study, we report safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of PHH-1V as a booster dose in subjects primary vaccinated against COVID-19 with the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1-S, or Ad26.COV2.S vaccines, with or without previous COVID-19 infection. A total of 2661 subjects were included in this study and vaccinated with the PHH-1V vaccine. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were solicited local and systemic reactions with grade 1 (58.70%) or grade 2 (27.58%) intensity, being the most frequently reported injection site pain (82.83%), fatigue (31.72%) and headache (31.23%). Additionally, immunogenicity was assessed at Baseline and Days 14, 91, 182 and 365 in a subset of 235 subjects primary vaccinated. On Day 14, geometric mean triter (GMT) in neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants increased in all primary vaccination with a geometric mean fold raise (GMFR) of 6.90 (95% CI 4.96-9.58), 12.27 (95% CI 8.52-17.67), 7.24 (95% CI 5.06-10.37) and 17.51 (95% CI 12.28-24.97), respectively. Despite GMT decay after day 14, it remains in all cases significatively higher from baseline up to 1 year after PHH-1V booster administration and GMFR against Beta and Omicron BA.1 variants over 3 at 1 year after booster compared to baseline. PHH-1V booster vaccination elicited also a significant RBD/Spike-specific IFN-γ+ T-cell responses on Day 14. Overall, PHH-1V vaccine was immunogenic and well-tolerated regardless of the previous primary vaccination scheme received with no reported cases of severe COVID-19 infection throughout the entire study.Competing Interest StatementThe authors of this manuscript declare SNM declares that her institution received payment from HIPRA for conducting this trial, from Pfizer, Sanofi, MSD, GSK, Janssen, AstraZeneca and Moderna for other vaccines trials and participation on data safety monitoring boards or advisory boards for GSK.

%X Detecting neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for controlling COVID-19 spread. We developed a high-throughput assay for the broad systematic examination of NAbs to eleven SARS-CoV-2 variants, which include D614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, and Omicron sub-lineages BA.1-BA.5. The assay is cost-effective, reliable, 35-fold more sensitive than Luminex technology, and can include new variants during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Importantly, our results highly correlated with a commercial IgG serological assay (R = 0.89), the FDA-approved cPass sVNT assay (R = 0.93), pseudivirus-based neutralizing assay (R = 0.96, R = 0.66, R = 0.65) and live virus based neutralization assay (R = 0.79, R = 0.64) . Using this platform, we constructed a comprehensive overview of the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 variants’ Spike trimer proteins and ACE2 receptors, and identified a polyclonal Ab with broad neutralizing activity. Furthermore, when compared to the D614G variant, we found that the serum NAbs elicited by the third dose vaccine demonstrated decreased inhibition to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Gamma (0.94×), Alpha (0.91×), Delta (0.91×), Beta (0.81×), Kappa (0.81×), BA.2 (0.44×), BA.1 (0.43×), BA.3 (0.41×), BA.5 (0.35×) and BA.4 (0.33×), in cohort of 56 vaccinated individuals. Altogether, our proteomics platform proves to be an effective tool to detect broad NAbs in the population and aid in the development of future COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (M23010 and L234034), National Key R&amp;D Program of China(2022YFE0210400, 2021YFA1301604, 2020YFE0202200), State Key Laboratory of Proteomics (SKLP-O202007), Academic leader of high-level public health technical personnel construction project of Beijing Municipal Health Commission (2022-2-014), Guangdong Province Science and Technology Planning Project (2020B1111100006), Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

%X Recombination plays a crucial role in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The Omicron XBB* recombinant lineages are a noteworthy example, as they have been the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide in the first half of 2023. Since November 2023, a new recombinant lineage between Omicron subvariants XBB and BA.2.86, designated XDR, has been detected mainly in Brazil. In this study, we reconstructed the spatiotemporal dynamics and estimated the absolute and relative transmissibility of the XDR lineage. The XDR lineage displayed a recombination breakpoint in the ORF1a coding region, and the most closely related sequences to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the recombinant correspond to JD.1.1 and JN.1.1 lineages, respectively. The first XDR sequences were detected in November 2023 in the Northeastern Brazilian region, and their prevalence rapidly surged from &lt;1% to 25% by February 2024. The Bayesian phylogeographic analysis supports that the XDR lineage likely emerged in the Northeastern Brazilian region around late October 2023 and rapidly disseminated within and outside Brazilian borders from mid-November onwards. The median effective reproductive number of the XDR lineage in Brazil during the initial expansion phase was estimated to be around 1.5. In contrast, the average relative instantaneous reproduction numbers of XDR and JN* lineages were estimated to be 1.37 and 1.29 higher than that of co-circulating XBB* lineages. In summary, these findings support that the recombinant lineage XDR arose in the Northeastern Brazilian region in October 2023, shortly after the first detection of JN.1 sequences in the country. In Brazil, the XDR lineage exhibited a higher transmissibility level than its parental XBB.* lineages and is spreading at a rate similar to or slightly faster than the JN.1* lineages.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DECIT) of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH), CGLab MoH (General Laboratories Coordination of Brazilian Ministry of Health), UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) by the New Variant Assessment Platform (NVAP) project, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), CVSLR FIOCRUZ (Coordination of Health Surveillance and Reference Laboratories of Oswaldo Cruz Foundation), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grant, CNPq COVID 19 (MCTI402457 2020 0 and 403276 2020 9), INOVA Fiocruz (VPPCB 005 FIO 20 2 and VPPCB 007 FIO 18 2 30), FAPERJ (E26 210.196 2020), FAPEAM (Rede Genomica de Vigilancia em Saude REGESAM), FAPEAM (INICIATIVA AMAZONIA + 10 [grant: 01.02.016301.00439 2023 70]), FAPEAM INOVA FIOCRUZ INOVAcaO NA AMAZONIA (Chamada Publica no. 04 2022), NPI EXPAND U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) implemented by Palladium (7200AA19CA00015), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Grant Award 002174), and CNPQ CABBIO (grant number 423857 2021 5), and FAPERJ (grant number E 26 211.125 202).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the FIOCRUZ (CAAE: 68118417.6.0000.5248 and CAAE:32333120.4.0000.5190), which waived signed informed consent for all participants.

%X Background The effective reproduction number (Re) serves as a metric of population-wide, time-varying disease spread. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Re was primarily estimated from clinical surveillance data streams (Rcc), which have varied in quality and representativeness due to changes in testing volume, test-seeking behavior, and resource constraints. Deriving Re from alternative data sources such as wastewater could inform future public health responses.Objectives We estimated county-aggregated, sewershed-restricted wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 Re (Rww) from May 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 for five counties in California of varying population sizes, clinical testing rates, demographics, proportions surveilled by wastewater, and sampling frequencies to validate the reliability of Rww as a real-time disease surveillance metric.Methods We produced both instantaneous and cohort sewershed-restricted Re using smoothed and deconvolved wastewater concentrations. We then population-weighted and aggregated these sewershed-level estimates to arrive at county-level Re. Using mean absolute error (MAE), Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ), confusion matrix classification, and cross-correlation analyses, we compared the timing and trajectory of two Rww models to: (1) a publicly available, county-level ensemble of Rcc estimates, and (2) a county-aggregated, sewershed-restricted Rcc.Results Both Rww models demonstrated high concordance with traditional Rcc estimates, as indicated by low mean absolute errors (MAE ≤ 0.09), significant positive Spearman correlation (Spearman ρ ≥ 0.66, p &lt; 0.001), and high confusion matrix classification accuracy (≥ 0.81). The relative timings of Rwwand Rcc were less clear, with cross-correlation analyses suggesting strong associations for a wide range of temporal lags that varied by county and Rww model type.Discussion This Re estimation methodology provides a generalizable, robust, and operationalizable framework for estimating county-level Rww. Our results support the additional use of Rwwas an epidemiological tool for surveillance. Based on this research, we produced publicly available Rww nowcasts for the California Communicable diseases Assessment Tool (https://calcat.covid19.ca.gov/cacovidmodels/).Competing Interest StatementThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of the California Department of Public Health or the California Health and Human Services Agency.Funding StatementThe wastewater sampling conducted through Method 1 was supported by gifts from the CDC Foundation and the Sergey Brin Family Foundation to ABB (coauthor).

%X Infectious diseases such as COVID-19 continue posing significant global health challenges, with recurrent re-infections contributing to long-term symptoms such as cardiac issues and anosmia. Effective management of re-infections relies heavily on maintaining high levels of circulating binding and neutralizing antibodies. Traditional methods for antibody quantification, such as ELISA, face significant challenges, including narrow dynamic ranges and complex sample preparation procedures, which hinder their applications in rapid and routine diagnosis. This study introduces a novel optofluidic biosensing technology, tip optofluidic immunoassay (TOI), that addresses these limitations by enabling the quantitative analysis of binding IgG against multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains from only 1 μL of fingertip blood. The proposed TOI system, featuring industrial-grade micro-fabricated immuno-reactors and a portable chemiluminescent imaging station, can provide test results within 12 minutes. For IgG binding assays, TOI possesses a lower limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL, a dynamic range of 3-4 orders of magnitude, along with a high signal-to-noise ratio (approximately 10,000). This technology not only simplifies the antibody quantification process but also enhances patient compliance and facilitates decentralized testing, which is crucial for infectious disease management. By enabling precise and rapid antibody assessment, this system can support the optimization of vaccination strategies and broader public health responses to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, and The Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging Science and System, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

%T Is SARS-CoV-2 elimination or mitigation best? Regional and disease characteristics determine the recommended strategy

%X Public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic varied across the world. Some countries (e.g., mainland China, New Zealand, and Taiwan) implemented elimination strategies involving strict travel measures and periods of rigorous nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the community, aiming to achieve periods with no disease spread; while others (e.g., many European countries and the United States of America) implemented mitigation strategies involving less strict NPIs for prolonged periods, aiming to limit community spread. Travel measures and community NPIs have high economic and social costs, and there is a need for guidelines that evaluate the appropriateness of an elimination or mitigation strategy in regional contexts. To guide decisions, we identify key criteria and provide indicators and visualizations to help answer each question. Considerations include determining whether disease elimination is: (1) necessary to ensure health care provision; (2) feasible from an epidemiological point of view; and (3) cost effective when considering, in particular, the economic costs of travel measures and treating infections. We discuss our recommendations by considering the regional and economic variability of Canadian provinces and territories, and the epidemiological characteristics of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. While elimination may be a preferable strategy for regions with limited health care capacity, low travel volumes, and few port of entries, mitigation may be more feasible in large urban areas with dense infrastructure, strong economies, and with high connectivity to other regions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementMM is grateful to the Azrieli fundation for the award of the Azrieli fellowship.

%X Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been widely applied in many countries and regions for monitoring COVID-19 transmission in the population through testing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater. However, the lack of dynamic level of viral shedding in the wastewater and accurate number of infections in the community creates challenges in predicting COVID-19 prevalence in the population and interpreting WBE results. In this study, we measured SARS-CoV-2, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), and human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in longitudinal fecal samples collected from 42 COVID-19 patients for up to 42 days after diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 73.1% (19/26) of inpatient study participants in at least one of the collected fecal specimens during the sampling period. Most participants shed the virus within three weeks after diagnosis, but five inpatient participants still shed the virus between 20 and 60 days after diagnosis. The median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in positive fecal samples was 1.08×105 genome copies (GC)/gram dry fecal material. PMMoV and mtDNA were detected in 99.4% (154/155) and 100% (155/155) of all fecal samples, respectively. The median concentrations of PMMoV RNA and mtDNA in fecal samples were 1.73×107 and 2.49×108 GC/dry gram, respectively. These results provide important information about the dynamics of fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 and two human fecal indicators in COVID-19 patients. mtDNA showed higher positive rates, higher concentrations, and less variability between and within individuals than PMMoV, suggesting that mtDNA could be a better normalization factor for WBE results than PMMoV.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative (contract No. 75N92021C00012 to Ceres Nanosciences, Inc) through a contract from Ceres Nanosciences to Emory University.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The ethical approval was granted by Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB00022371) for this studyI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Continued phenotyping and ongoing surveillance are important in current and future monitoring of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Herein we developed pragmatic strategies to track the emergence, spread and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Australia in an era of decreasing diagnostic PCR testing and focused cohort-based studies. This was aligned to longitudinal studies that span 4 years of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods Throughout 2023, we partnered with diagnostic pathology providers and pathogen genomics teams to identify relevant emerging or circulating variants in the New South Wales (NSW) community. We monitored emerging variants through viral culture, growth algorithms, neutralization responses and change entry requirements defined by ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor use. To frame this in the context of the pandemic stage, we continued to longitudinally track neutralisation responses at the population level using using sequential batches of pooled Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIG) derived from in excess of 700,000 donations.Findings In antibodies derived from recent individual donations and thousands of donations pooled in IVIGs, we observed continued neutralization across prior and emerging variants with EG.5.1, HV.1, XCT and JN.1 ranked as the most evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants. Changes in the type I antibody site at Spike positions 452, 455 and 456 were associated with lowered neutralization responses in XBB lineages. In longitudinal tracking of population immunity spanning three years, we observed continued maturation of neutralization breadth to all SARS-CoV-2 variants over time. Whilst neutralization responses initially displayed high levels of imprinting towards Ancestral and early pre-Omicron lineages, this was slowly countered by increased cross reactive breadth to all variants. We predicted JN.1 to have a significant transmission advantage in late 2023 and this eventuated globally at the start of 2024. We could not attributed this advantage to neutralization resistance but rather propose that this growth advantage arises from the preferential utilization of TMPRSS2 cleavage-resistant ACE2.Interpretation The emergence of many SARS-CoV-2 lineages documented at the end of 2023 to be initially associated with lowered neutralization responses. This continued to be countered by the gradual maturation of cross reactive neutralization responses over time. The later appearance and dominance of the divergent JN.1 lineage cannot be attributed to a lack of neutralization responses alone, and we support its dominance to be the culmination of both lowered neutralization and changes in ACE2/TMPRSS2 entry preferences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was primarily supported by Australian Medical Foundation research grants MRF2005760 (SGT, GM &amp; WDR), Medical Research Future Fund Antiviral Development Call grant (WDR), the New South Wales Health COVID-19 Research Grants Round 2 (SGT &amp; FB) and the NSW Vaccine Infection and Immunology Collaborative (VIIM) (ALC).

%X The COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC) was characterized by marked disparities in disease burdens across neighborhoods. Accurate neighborhood-level forecasts are critical for planning more equitable resource allocation; however, such spatially high-resolution forecasts remain scarce in operational use. Here, we analyze aggregated foot traffic data derived from mobile devices to measure the connectivity among 42 NYC neighborhoods driven by various human activities such as dining, shopping, and entertainment. Using real-world time-varying contact patterns in different place categories, we develop a parsimonious behavior-driven epidemic model that incorporates population mixing, indoor crowdedness, dwell time, and seasonality of virus transmissibility. This process-based model supports accurate modeling of neighborhood-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission throughout 2020. In the best-fitting model, we estimate that the force of infection in indoor settings increases sublinearly with crowdedness and dwell time. Retrospective forecasting demonstrates that this behavior-driven model generates improved short-term forecasts in NYC neighborhoods. This model may be adapted for use with other respiratory pathogens sharing similar transmission routes.Competing Interest StatementJS and Columbia University disclose partial ownership of SK Analytics.

%T A unifying model to explain high nirmatrelvir therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, despite low post-exposure prophylaxis efficacy and frequent viral rebound

%X In a pivotal trial (EPIC-HR), a 5-day course of oral ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, given early during symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (within three days of symptoms onset), decreased hospitalization and death by 89.1% and nasal viral load by 0.87 log relative to placebo in high-risk individuals. Yet, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir failed as post-exposure prophylaxis in a trial, and frequent viral rebound has been observed in subsequent cohorts. We developed a mathematical model capturing viral-immune dynamics and nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics that recapitulated viral loads from this and another clinical trial (PLATCOV). Our results suggest that nirmatrelvir’s in vivo potency is significantly lower than in vitro assays predict. According to our model, a maximally potent agent would reduce the viral load by approximately 3.5 logs relative to placebo at 5 days. The model identifies that earlier initiation and shorter treatment duration are key predictors of post-treatment rebound. Extension of treatment to 10 days for Omicron variant infection in vaccinated individuals, rather than increasing dose or dosing frequency, is predicted to lower the incidence of viral rebound significantly.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01AI169427, R01AI121129, and R01AI177512Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data analyzed in this work was previously published by Hay et al. and Schilling et al. and is available on github at https://github.com/gradlab/SC2-kinetics-immune-history and https://github.com/jwatowatson/PLATCOV-Molnupiravir/tree/V1.0I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%T Mathematical assessment of wastewater-based epidemiology to predict SARS-CoV-2 cases and hospitalizations in Miami-Dade County

%X This study presents a wastewater-based mathematical model for assessing the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, monitors the temporal dynamics of the disease, as well as changes in viral RNA concentration in the county’s wastewater system (which consists of three sewage treatment plants). The model was calibrated using the wastewater data during the third wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Miami-Dade (specifically, the time period from July 3, 2021 to October 9, 2021). The calibrated model was used to predict SARS-CoV-2 case and hospitalization trends in the county during the aforementioned time period, showing a strong correlation (with a correlation coefficient r = 0.99) between the observed (detected) weekly case data and the corresponding weekly data predicted by the calibrated model. The model’s prediction of the week when maximum number of SARS-CoV-2 cases will be recorded in the county during the simulation period precisely matches the time when the maximum observed/reported cases were recorded (which was August 14, 2021). Furthermore, the model’s projection of the maximum number of cases for the week of August 14, 2021 is about 15 times higher than the maximum observed weekly case count for the county on that day (i.e., the maximum case count estimated by the model was 15 times higher than the actual/observed count for confirmed cases). This result is consistent with the result of numerous SARS-CoV-2 modeling studies (including other wastewater-based modeling, as well as statistical models) in the literature. Furthermore, the model accurately predicts a one-week lag between the peak in weekly COVID-19 case and hospitalization data during the time period of the study in Miami-Dade, with the model-predicted hospitalizations peaking on August 21, 2021. Detailed time-varying global sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the parameters (wastewater-based, epidemiological and biological) that have the most influence on the chosen response function - the cumulative viral load in the wastewater. This analysis revealed that the transmission rate of infectious individuals, shedding rate of infectious individuals, recovery rate of infectious individuals, average fecal load per person per unit time and the proportion of shed viral RNA that is not lost in sewage before measurement at the wastewater treatment plant were most influential to the response function during the entire time period of the study. This study shows, conclusively, that wastewater surveillance data can be a very powerful indicator for measuring (i.e., providing early-warning signal and current burden) and predicting the future trajectory and burden (e.g., number of cases and hospitalizations) of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2, in a community.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNational Science FoundationAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Key pointsCurrent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine induces salivary and nasal SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG but not IgA production in children under 5 years of ageMucosal anti-spike IgA is important for immune complex-mediated neutrophil extracellular trap formation against SARS-CoV-2 in the airwayBackground Understanding antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is crucial for refining COVID-19 immunization strategies. Generation of mucosal immune responses, including mucosal IgA, could be of potential benefit to vaccine efficacy, yet limited evidence exists regarding the production of mucosal antibodies following the administration of current mRNA vaccines to young children.Methods We measured the levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from a cohort of children under 5 years of age undergoing SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination (serially collected, matched serum and saliva samples, N=116) or on convenience samples of children under 5 years of age presenting to a pediatric emergency department (nasal swabs, N=103). Further, we assessed salivary and nasal samples for the ability to induce SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation.Results Longitudinal analysis of post-vaccine responses in saliva revealed the induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG but not IgA. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA was only observed in nasal samples obtained from previously infected children with or without vaccination, but not in vaccinated children without a history of infection. In addition, oronasopharyngeal samples obtained from children with prior infection were able to trigger enhanced spike-mediated NET formation, and IgA played a key role in driving this process.Conclusions Despite the induction of specific IgG in the oronasal mucosa, current intramuscular vaccines have limited ability to generate mucosal IgA in young children. These results confirm the independence of mucosal IgA responses from systemic humoral responses following mRNA vaccination and suggest potential future vaccination strategies for enhancing mucosal protection in this young age group.Competing Interest StatementDavid Walt has a financial interest in Quanterix Corporation, a company that develops an ultra-sensitive digital immunoassay platform.

%X Background Understanding the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the asymptomatic fraction, is important as asymptomatic individuals are still able to infect other individuals and contribute to ongoing transmission. The WHO Unity Household transmission investigation (HHTI) protocol provides a platform for the prospective and systematic collection of high-quality clinical, epidemiological, serological, and virological data from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and their household contacts. These data can be used to understand key severity and transmissibility parameters — including the asymptomatic proportion — in relation to local epidemic context and help inform public health response.Methods We aimed to estimate the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-variant infections in Unity-aligned HHTIs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in alignment with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered our systematic review on PROSPERO (CRD42022378648). We searched EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and bioRxiv and medRxiv from 1 November 2021 to 22 August 2023.Results We identified 8,368 records, of which 98 underwent full text review. We identified only three studies for data extraction, with substantial variation in study design and corresponding estimates of the asymptomatic proportion. As a result, we did not generate a pooled estimate or I2 metric.Conclusions The limited number of quality studies that we identified highlights the need for improved preparedness and response capabilities to facilitate robust HHTI implementation, analysis and reporting, to better inform national, regional and global risk assessments and policy making.Key messagesEstimates for the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-variant infections are highly heterogeneousWe assessed the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-variant infections among household contacts, who were followed prospectively and systematically, per the WHO Unity household transmission investigation protocol.Given the small number of studies with sufficient data and the observed heterogeneity in the asymptomatic proportion point estimates, we did not provide a pooled estimate of the asymptomatic proportion.Fit-for-purpose study designs, and improved reporting, are necessary for robust estimation of epidemiological characteristics from household studies and their interpretation.Ongoing assessment of the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to inform ongoing public health response options such as testing strategies to detect infections and isolation guidance for close contacts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAJM and DJP are supported by funding from Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Partnership (#1195895).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data underlying this article are available in the article, included publicly available articles and online supplementary material.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Individuals’ perceptions of disease influence their adherence to preventive measures, shaping the dynamics of disease spread. Despite extensive research on the interaction between disease spread, human behaviors, and interventions, few models have incorporated real-world behavioral data on disease perception, limiting their applicability. This study novelly integrates disease perception, represented by perceived severity, as a critical determinant of behavioral change into a data-driven compartmental model to assess its impact on disease spread. Using survey data, we explore scenarios involving a competition between a COVID-19 wave and a vaccination campaign, where individuals’ behaviors vary based on their perceived severity of the disease. Results demonstrate that behavioral heterogeneities influenced by perceived severity affect epidemic dynamics, with high heterogeneity yielding contrasting effects. Longer adherence to protective measures by groups with high perceived severity provides greater protection to vulnerable individuals, while premature relaxation of behaviors by low perceived severity groups facilitates virus spread. Epidemiological curves reveal that differences in behavior among groups can eliminate a second infection peak, resulting in a higher first peak and overall more severe outcomes. The specific modeling approach for how perceived severity modulates behavior parameters does not strongly impact the model’s outcomes. Sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our findings, emphasizing the consistent impact of behavioral heterogeneities across various scenarios. Our study underscores the importance of integrating risk perception into infectious disease transmission models and highlights the necessity of extensive data collection to enhance model accuracy and relevance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the VERDI project (101045989), funded by the European Union.

%X Background Pacific Islanders are underrepresented in vaccine efficacy trials. Few studies describe their immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Yet, this characterization is crucial to re-enforce vaccination strategies adapted to Pacific Islanders singularities.Methods We evaluated the humoral immune response of 585 adults self-declaring as Melanesians, Europeans, Polynesians or belonging to other communities to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. Anti-Spike and anti-Nucleoprotein IgG levels, capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants and capacity to mediate Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) were assessed across communities at one and three months post-second dose or one and six months post-third dose.Results 61.3% of the sera tested contained anti-Nucleoprotein antibodies, evidencing mostly a hybrid immunity resulting from vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-Spike IgG levels and capacity to mediate Omicron neutralization and ADCC were equivalent across the four ethnic communities at one-month post-immunization, during follow-up and at six months post-third dose, regardless of the infection status. Obese individuals (BMI&gt;30 kg/m²) had significantly higher anti-Spike IgG levels at one-month post-immunization (+0.26 (0.04; 0.48) AU in LuLISA assay, p value = 0.017). Odds of Omicron neutralization at six months after the third dose decreased significantly in the 40-64 years and ≥65 years groups (OR (95% CI) 0.48 (0.24-0.90) and 0.29 (0.14-0.58) respectively, p-value = 0.003).Conclusions Our study evidenced Pacific Islander’s robust humoral immune response to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine, which is pivotal to re-enforce vaccination deployment in a population at risk for severe COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05135585).summary Ethnicity has little impact on Pacific Islanders’ hybrid humoral immune response to BNT162b2 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-Spike IgG levels, capacity to neutralize Omicron variants and capacity to mediate Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity are equivalent across Pacific communities following BNT162b2 vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThis study was recorded on clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT05135585).Funding StatementYesAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the “Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile-de-France III” (n° ID-RCB 2021-A01949-32, CPP n° 4003-I, November 9th 2021, Am8898-1-4003 January 17th, 2022, Am9503-2-4003 April, 4th 2022 and Am9508-3-4003 June 21st, 2022) and by the Consultative Ethics Committee of New Caledonia.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The level of neutralizing antibodies required to confer protection against COVID-19 breakthrough infections (BIs) is unclear, and the ability to know the immune status of individuals against the rapidly changing endemic variants is limited. We assessed longitudinal serum anti-RBD antibody levels and neutralizing activities (NTs) against Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1.5 in healthcare workers following the fourth monovalent and fifth bivalent BA.4-5 vaccines. The occurrence of BIs was also followed, and pre-infection antibody levels were compared between patients who developed BI and those who did not. In addition, we collected whole blood samples on the same day as the sera and stored them on filter papers (nos. 545, 590, and 424) for up to two months, then measured their NTs using dried blood spots (DBS) eluates, and compared them with the NTs in paired sera. Pre-infection levels of NTs were lower in patients who developed BI than those who did not, but the anti-RBD antibody levels were not different between them. The NTs below 50% using 200-fold diluted sera might be one of the indicators of high risk for COVID-19 BI. However, the NTs against XBB.1.5 at 6 months after the fifth dose of bivalent BA.4-5 vaccine were lower than this threshold in almost half of infection-naïve participants. NTs measured using DBS eluates were strongly correlated with those measured using paired sera, but the time and temperature stability varied with the type of filter paper; no. 545 filter paper was found to most suitable for NT evaluation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases from the AMED (grant no.

%T The Burr distribution as a model for the delay between key events in an individual’s infection history

%X Understanding the temporal relationship between key events in an individual’s infection history is crucial for disease control. Delay data between events, such as infection and symptom onset times, is doubly censored because the exact time at which these key events occur is generally unknown. Current mathematical models for delay distributions rely solely on heuristic justifications for their applicability. Here, we derive a new model for delay distributions, specifically for incubation periods, motivated by bacterial-growth dynamics that lead to the Burr family of distributions being a valid modelling choice. We also incorporate methods within these models to account for the doubly censored data. Our approach provides biological justification in the derivation of our delay distribution model, the results of fitting to data highlighting the superiority of the Burr model compared to currently used models in the literature. Our results indicate that the derived Burr distribution is 13 times more likely to be a better-performing model to incubation-period data than currently used methods. Further, we show that incorporating methods for handling the censoring issue results in the mean of the underlying continuous incubation-period model being reduced by a whole day, compared to the mean obtained under alternative modelling techniques in the literature.Author summary In public health, it is important to know key temporal properties of diseases (such as how long someone is ill for or infectious for). Mathematical characterisation of properties requires information about patients’ infection histories, such as the number of days between infection and symptom onset, for example. These methods provide useful insights, such as how their infectiousness varies over time since they were infected. However, two key issues arise with these approaches. First, these methods do not have strong arguments for the validity of their usage. Second, the data typically used is provided as a rounded number of days between key events, as opposed to the exact period of time. We address both these issues by developing a new mathematical model to describe the important properties of the infection process of various diseases based on strong biological justification, and further incorporating methods within the mathematical model which consider infection and symptom onset to occur at any point within an interval, as opposed to an exact time. Our approach provides more preferable results, based on AIC, than existing approaches, enhancing the understanding of properties of diseases such as Legionnaires’ disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.

%X Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at enhanced risk of adverse outcomes following infectious challenges due to immunosuppressive treatment and additional comorbidities. Unfortunately, SOT recipients are also poor responders to the key medical intervention to preventing infection: vaccines. Here we performed a systems vaccinology study on a cohort of 59 kidney transplant recipients and 31 lung transplant recipients who received the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Analyzing the immunological status of the patients prior to vaccination, we were able to identify multiple immunological associates of relatively improved vaccine responses following two or three doses of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. These immunological associates predicted, with 95.0% and 93.3% accuracy, vaccine response after the second and third dose, respectively. Comparison of the immunological associates with vaccine response in SOT recipients revealed two distinct immune configurations: a non-classical configuration, distinct from the immune state of healthy subjects, associated with responses to two doses of mRNA vaccine and that could be mediated partly by the presence of double negative B cell subsets which are more prominently represented in responsive SOT recipients, and a “normalized” configuration, closer to the immune state of healthy subjects, associated with potent antibody responses to three doses of mRNA vaccine. These results suggest that immunosuppression in SOT recipients can result in distinct immune states associated with different trade-offs in vaccine responsiveness. Immune phenotyping of SOT recipients for immune constellation may be an effective approach for identifying patients most at risk of poor vaccine responses and susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases.One-sentence summary SOT recipients showed distinct immune states at baseline associated with different profiles of vaccine-associated immune response.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was co-funded by the Belgian Federal Government through Sciensano and by the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS) Belgium.

%X Background SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits distinct clinical features in children and adults. Profiling the adaptive immune response following infection in children is essential to better understand and characterize these differences.Methods Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses from unvaccinated pediatric and adult participants were analyzed following asymptomatic or mild non-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection. Levels of IgG and IgA targeting spike (S), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured, while neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were assessed against three viral strains (Wuhan, Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5). Specific T-cell memory responses were investigated by quantifying interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secreting cells after stimulation with ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2, and seasonal human β- coronaviruses (HCoV)-OC43 and -HKU1.Results The study comprised 28 children (3 to 17 [median=10] years old) and 28 adults (19 to 62 [median=42]). At a mean time of seven months (± 2.8 months) after SARS-CoV-2 infection, children and adults mounted comparable antibody levels against S and RBD, as well as similar neutralization capacity. However, children displayed a weaker cellular memory response to SARS- CoV-2 than adults, with a median of 88 [28-184] spot forming units per million of PBMCs in children compared to 208 [141-340] in adults (***, P &lt; .001). In children, the level of IFN-γ secreting cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to that of seasonal coronaviruses.Conclusion Long-term memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are enhanced in adults compared to children who demonstrate equivalent responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoV.HIGHLIGHTSChildren infected with SARS-CoV-2 show comparable binding and neutralizing antibody levels as adults seven months after infection.There are notable differences in the intensity of the T-cell response following SARS-CoV- 2 infection between children and adults.Children have more pronounced T-cell immunodominance towards the spike versus non- spike proteins compared to adults at seven months post-infectionIn contrast, T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are globally reduced in children compared to adults but are alike to other seasonal β-coronaviruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the CHAMO Innovation Fund (FPOC# CHA-21-010) and PSI Foundation (Grant # 21-22).

%X Background Influenza A results in significant morbidity and mortality. VIR-2482, an engineered human monoclonal antibody with extended half-life, targets a highly conserved epitope on the stem region of influenza A hemagglutinin, and may protect against seasonal and pandemic influenza.Methods This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study examined the safety and efficacy of VIR-2482 for seasonal influenza A illness prevention in unvaccinated healthy adults. Participants (N = 2977) were randomized 1:1:1 to receive VIR-2482 450 mg, VIR-2482 1200 mg, or placebo via intramuscular (IM) injection. Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were the proportions of participants with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–confirmed influenza A infection and either protocol-defined influenza-like illness (ILI) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)–defined ILI or World Health Organization (WHO)–defined ILI, respectively.Results VIR-2482 450 mg and 1200 mg prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of protocol-defined ILI with RT-PCR–confirmed influenza A versus placebo (relative risk reduction [RRR], 3.8% [95% CI: −67.3, 44.6] and 15.9% [95% CI: −49.3, 52.3], respectively). At the 1200 mg dose, the RRRs in influenza A illness were 57.2% [95% CI: −2.5, 82.2] using CDC-ILI and 44.1% [95% CI: −50.5, 79.3] using WHO-ILI definitions, respectively. Serum VIR-2482 levels were similar regardless of influenza status; variants with reduced VIR-2482 susceptibility were not detected. Local injection-site reactions were mild and similar across groups.Conclusion VIR-2482 1200 mg IM was well tolerated but did not significantly prevent protocol-defined ILI. Secondary endpoint analyses suggest this dose may have reduced influenza A illness.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT05567783Key points Prophylactic administration of 1200 mg of VIR-2482, an engineered human monoclonal antibody targeting a highly conserved epitope on the stem region of influenza A hemagglutinin, did not significantly reduce risk of influenza-like illness from influenza A virus in healthy adults.Competing Interest StatementSusanna K.

%T Improving estimates of epidemiological quantities by combining reported cases with wastewater data: a statistical framework with applications to COVID-19 in Aotearoa New Zealand

%X Background Timely and informed public health responses to infectious diseases such as COVID-19 necessitate reliable information about infection dynamics. The case ascertainment rate (CAR), the proportion of infections that are reported as cases, is typically much less than one and varies with testing practices and behaviours, making reported cases unreliable as the sole source of data. The concentration of viral RNA in wastewater samples provides an alternate measure of infection prevalence that is not affected by clinical testing, healthcare-seeking behaviour or access to care.Methods We constructed a state-space model with observed data of levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and reported case incidence and estimated the hidden states of R and CAR using sequential Monte Carlo methods.Results Here, we analysed data from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2023 from Aotearoa New Zealand. Our model estimates that R peaked at 2.76 (95% CrI 2.20, 3.83) around 18 February 2022 and the CAR peaked around 12 March 2022. We calculate that New Zealand’s second Omicron wave in July 2022 was similar in size to the first, despite fewer reported cases. We estimate that the CAR in the BA.5 Omicron wave in July 2022 was approximately 50% lower than in the BA.1/BA.2 Omicron wave in March 2022.Conclusions Estimating R, CAR, and cumulative number of infections provides useful information for planning public health responses and understanding the state of immunity in the population. This model is a useful disease surveillance tool, improving situational awareness of infectious disease dynamics in real-time.Plain Language Summary To make informed public health decisions about infectious diseases, it is important to understand the number of infections in the community. Reported cases, however, underestimate the number of infections and the degree of underestimation likely changes with time. Wastewater data provides an alternative data source that does not depend on testing practices. Here, we combined wastewater observations of SARS-CoV-2 with reported cases to estimate the reproduction number (how quickly infections are increasing or decreasing) and the case ascertainment rate (the fraction of infections reported as cases). We apply the model to Aotearoa New Zealand and demonstrate that the second wave of infections in July 2022 had approximately the same number of infections as the first wave in March 2022 despite reported cases being 50% lower.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by New Zealand Ministry of Health, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Royal Society Te Apārangi, Imperial College London, and University of Oxford.

%X The COVID-19 pandemic was the most dramatic in the newest history with nearly 7 million deaths and global impact on mankind. Here we report binding index of 305 HLA class I molecules from 18,771 unique haplotypes of 28,104 individuals to 821 peptides experimentally observed from spike protein RBD of 5 main SARS-CoV-2 strains hydrolyzed by human proteasomes with constitutive and immune catalytic phenotypes. Our data read that mutations in the hACE2-binding region RBD496-513 of Omicron B.1.1.529 strain results in a dramatic increase of proteasome-mediated release of two public HLA class I epitopes. Global population analysis of HLA class I haplotypes, specific to these peptides, demonstrated decreased mortality of human populations enriched in these haplotypes from COVID-19 after but not before December, 2021, when Omicron became dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain. Noteworthy, currently circulating BA.2.86 and JN.1 lineages contain no amino acid substitutions in RBD496-513 thus preserving identified core epitopes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported, in part, by RSF grants 21-74-10154 (to A.A.K.)

%X Background and objectives Healthcare workers are a high-risk group for COVID-19 and protecting them is crucial for healthcare delivery. Limited studies have explored compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC) practices among Somali healthcare workers. This study aimed to determine compliance with IPC practices among healthcare workers in De Martino Public Hospital, Somalia.Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at De Martino Public Hospital, Mogadishu, Somalia from August to October 2022, with the participation of 204 healthcare workers (response rate = %97). Compliance was assessed using responses to 25 questions on a five-point Likert-type scale, and the median score of 20 was used to dichotomize compliance scores. A chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were performed to check the associations between healthcare workers’ sociodemographic information, related factors to IPC, work conditions and practices on COVID-19, and IPC compliance during healthcare interventions using SPSS 23 version.Results In total, 58.3% of the participants had good compliance with IPC. There were significant associations between IPC compliance and the type of healthcare worker (doctors and doctor assistants: 72.3%, nurses and paramedical staff: 67.3%, non-clinical staff: 5.7%, p&lt;0.01). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, compared to non-clinical staff, doctors and doctor assistants (OR: 12.11, 95% CI: 2.23-65.84) nurses and paramedical staff (OR: 21.38, 95% CI: 4.23 - 108.01) had higher compliance with infection prevention and control measures. There were no significant associations between compliance and gender, marital status, vaccination status, or smoking (p&gt;0.05 for all).Conclusions Inadequate compliance with COVID-19 IPC measures was observed among hospital workers. Prioritizing awareness campaigns and behavior change interventions, especially among non-clinical staff, is crucial for effective COVID-19 infection prevention and control within the hospital.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe author(s) received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.Not ApplicableThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Dokuz Eylul University, Non-Interventional Research Ethics CommitteeI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.Not ApplicableI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The reproduction number, the mean number of secondary cases infected by each primary case, is a central metric in infectious disease epidemiology, and played a key role in the COVID-19 pandemic response. This is because it gives an indication of the effort required to control the disease. Beyond the well-known basic reproduction number, there are two natural versions, namely the control and effective reproduction numbers. As behaviour, population immunity and viral characteristics can change with time, these reproduction numbers can vary over time and in different regions.Real world data can be complex, for example with daily variation in numbers due to weekend surveillance biases as well as natural stochastic noise. As such, in this work we consider a Generalised Additive Model to smooth real data through the explicit incorporation of day-of-the-week effects, to provide a simple measure of the time-varying growth rate associated with the data.Converting the resulting spline into an estimator for both the control and effective reproduction numbers requires assumptions on a model structure, which we here assume to be a compartmental model. The reproduction numbers calculated are based on both simulated and real world data, and are compared with estimates from an already existing tool.The derived method for estimating the time-varying reproduction number is effective, efficient and comparable to other methods. It provides a useful alternative approach, which can be included as part of a toolbox of models, that is particularly apt at smoothing out day-of-the-week effects in surveillance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementLP gratefully acknowledges the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society (grant 202562/Z/16/Z).

%T Does behavior mediate the effect of weather on SARS-CoV-2 transmission? Evidence from cell-phone data

%X Background There is growing evidence that weather alters SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but it remains unclear what drives the phenomenon. One prevailing hypothesis is that people spend more time indoors in cooler weather, leading to increased spread of SARS-CoV-2 related to time spent in confined spaces and close contact with others. However, the evidence in support of that hypothesis is limited and, at times, conflicting.Objectives We aim to evaluate the extent to which weather impacts COVID-19 via time spent away-from-home in indoor spaces, as compared to a direct effect of weather on COVID-19 hospitalization, independent of mobility.Methods We use a mediation framework, and combine daily weather, COVID-19 hospital surveillance, cellphone-based mobility data and building footprints to estimate the relationship between daily indoor and outdoor weather conditions, mobility, and COVID-19 hospitalizations. We quantify the direct health impacts of weather on COVID-19 hospitalizations and the indirect effects of weather via time spent indoors away-from-home on COVID-19 hospitalizations within five Colorado counties between March 4th 2020 and January 31st 2021.Results We found evidence that changes in 12-day lagged hospital admissions were primarily via the direct effects of weather conditions, rather than via indirect effects by which weather changes time spent indoors away-from-home. Sensitivity analyses evaluating time at home as a mediator were consistent with these conclusions.Discussion Our findings do not support the hypothesis that weather impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission via changes in mobility patterns during the first year of the pandemic. Rather, weather appears to have impacted SARS-CoV-2 transmission primarily via mechanisms other than human movement. We recommend further analysis of this phenomenon to determine whether these findings generalize to current SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and other seasonal respiratory pathogens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported through the MIDAS Coordination Center (MIDASSUP2020-3) by a grant from the National Institute of General Medical Science (3U24GM132013-02S2), and by Cooperative Agreement number NU38OT000297 from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and does not necessarily represent the views of CDC and CSTE.

%T Cohort Profile: Immune Responses to SARS-COV-2 Vaccination and Infection in a Longitudinal Sampling Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic (LONGTONG-SARS2) in Malaysia

%X Purpose This prospective, longitudinal study aims to evaluate the durability and functionality of SARS-CoV-2 Ancestral strain (Wuhan-Hu-1)-specific immune responses induced by COVID-19 vaccination and natural infection over a 12-month period. This article reviews the study protocol, design, methodology, ongoing data collection, analysis procedures, and demographic characteristics of the cohort enrolled.Participants Between March 2021 and May 2022, 400 participants were enrolled with a 12-month follow-up, concluding in May 2023. Two main groups of participants: (1) serologically SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals receiving the BNT162b2 primary series vaccination (referred to as VAC) and (2) those who recently recovered from COVID-19 infection within 30 days, regardless of vaccination history (referred to as COV). Additionally, a subset of 45 participants with selected COVID-19 exposure histories provided peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for cross-sectional analysis six months after enrollment.Findings to date Out of 400 participants, 66.8% (n=267) completed the follow-up. Among them, 52.8% (n=141) were in VAC, and 47.2% (n=126) were in COV. As the study progressed, we acknowledged cross-over between initial groups, leading to restructuring into five revised groups based on sequential exposure events. Sociodemographic factors revealed statistically significant age distribution differences (p=0.001) in both initial and revised groups, with no significant differences observed for sex.Future plans LONGTONG-SARS2 assesses the host-pathogen interactions central to the development of COVID-19 immunity. With enrollment spanning two years of the pandemic, most participants exhibited mixed SARS-CoV-2 exposures—via vaccination and infection—resulting in diverse subgroups of interest. Notably, the inclusion of SARS-CoV-2-naïve, pre-exposure serum samples allowed for robust comparator and reduced potential biases. Ongoing analyses will include serology kinetics, memory cells ELISpots, B cells repertoire analysis, cytokine/chemokine profiling, and proteomic pathway to comprehensively examine the immune response against the SARS-CoV-2, thus informing and potentially predicting dynamic longitudinal responses against new more transmissible, immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants.STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY- LONGTONG-SARS2 is a prospective longitudinal study that comprehensively evaluates the SARS-CoV-2 immune response among a diverse group of individuals, stratified based on the sequential order of SARS-CoV-2 exposure events, whether from COVID-19 vaccination or infection.- Pre-vaccination serum samples were collected from serologically SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals scheduled to receive the BNT162b2 primary series vaccination during the initial mass COVID-19 vaccination phase in Malaysia in early 2021.- The longitudinal serum sample collection spanned two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 2021 to May 2023. This extended duration allows for robust monitoring of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 variants in comparison to the ancestral strain.- There is a risk of misclassification of some individuals’ SARS-CoV-2 exposure status through serology, as certain sampling timepoints had intervals of three months. Additionally, our study relies on self-reported data through the MySejahtera application (Malaysia’s electronic medical record by the Ministry of Health) for second confirmation, potentially leading to underdiagnosed and underreported cases of asymptomatic infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was supported by funds from the U.S. Joint Program Executive Office under the 2020-2021 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval was obtained from Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (MREC-UMMC SID: 2021226-9886)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics often include virological secondary endpoints to compare viral clearance and viral load reduction between treatment and placebo arms. This is typically achieved using RT-qPCR, which cannot differentiate replicant competent virus from non-viable virus or free RNA, limiting its utility as an endpoint. Culture based methods for SARS-CoV-2 exist; however, these are often insensitive and poorly standardised for use as clinical trial endpoints.We report optimisation of a culture-based approach evaluating three cell lines, three detection methods, and key culture parameters. We show that Vero-ACE2-TMPRSS2 (VAT) cells in combination with RT-qPCR of culture supernatants from the first passage provides the greatest overall detection of Delta viral replication (22/32, 68.8%), being able to identify viable virus in 83.3% (20/24) of clinical samples with initial Ct values &lt;30. Likewise, we demonstrate that RT-qPCR using culture supernatants from the first passage of Vero hSLAM cells provides the highest overall detection of Omicron viral replication (9/31, 29%), detecting live virus in 39.1% (9/23) of clinical samples with initial Ct values &lt; 25.

%X We used a modified screening method that ensures quasi-exchangeability of comparison groups to estimate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in people resident in the Federal State of Hessen, Germany. COVID-19 vaccination history of vaccinated subjects with reported symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was used to determine vaccination status. Subjects with their first COVID-19 vaccination within 7 days before the imputed date of infection were considered unvaccinated. Vaccination is assumed not to have a relevant effect on outcome risk for the first seven days and to be fully developed after between 14 and 21 days. The immunization profile of the source population was estimated from the number of subjects vaccinated by dose, date and age group as recorded in the Hessian COVID-19 vaccination registry. Effect estimates were obtained using logistic regression, fitted by a Bayesian approach. The first dose of COVID-19 vaccines had a measurable effect during the predominance of the Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, but a smaller effect during Omicron predominance. Only during Alpha and Delta predominance did the second dose provide an added benefit. During Omicron predominance, the third dose provided additional protection, but that effect was smaller than for the Delta period. Comparison of our estimates with estimates using a conventional, not quasi-exchangeable, approach revealed substantial differences in some cases, without any recognizable pattern.PACS 0000, 1111MSC 0000, 1111HighlightsWe propose a vaccine effectiveness (VE) study design for COVID-19 that is based on a modification of the screening method. The modification ensures quasi-exchangeable: Only vaccinated subjects are considered, COVID-19 cases on the one hand and subjects registered in the COVID-19 vaccination registry. Risk comparisons are calculated for individuals who received their n-th vaccination one to two weeks apart, assuming no relevant vaccine effect within a week.The first dose of COVID-19 vaccines had a measurable effect during the predominance of the Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, but a smaller effect during Omicron predominance.

%X Various vaccine platforms were developed and deployed against the COVID-19 disease. The Fc-mediated functions of IgG antibodies are essential in the adaptive immune response elicited by vaccines. However, the long-term changes of protein subunit vaccines and their combinations with mRNA vaccines are unknown. A total of 272 serum and plasma samples were collected from individuals who received first to third doses of the protein subunit Medigen, the mRNA (BNT), or the adenovector AstraZeneca vaccines. The IgG subclass level was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Fc-N glycosylation was measured using LC-MS/MS. Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement deposition (ADCD) of anti-spike (S) IgG antibodies were measured. IgG1 and 3 reached the highest anti-S IgG subclass level. IgG1, 2, and 4 subclass levels significantly increased in mRNA- and Medigen-vaccinated individuals. Fc-glycosylation was stable, except in female BNT vaccinees, who showed increased bisection and decreased galactosylation. Female BNT vaccinees had a higher anti-S IgG titer than that of males. ADCP declined in all groups. ADCD increased in Medigen-vaccinated individuals after the third dose. Each vaccine produced specific long-term changes in Fc structure and function. This finding is critical when selecting a vaccine platform or combination to achieve the desired immune response.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project was funded by the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan (grant number: EMRPD1N0071) and "National Institutes of Health, USA (grant number: U01 AI151698) for the United World Antiviral Research Network (UWARN)."Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Diagnostics Investigational Review Board of Cummaquid, MA, USA gave ethical approval of the sample collection.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) gained widespread use as a tool for supporting clinical disease surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is now significant interest in the continued development of WBE for other pathogens of clinical significance. In this study, approximately 3,200 samples of wastewater from across England, previously collected for quantification of SARS-CoV-2, were re-analysed for the quantification of norovirus genogroup I (GI) and II (GII). Overall, GI and GII were detected in 93% and 98% of samples respectively, and at least one of the genogroups was detected in 99% of samples. GI was found at significantly lower concentrations than GII, but the proportion of each genogroup varied over time, with GI becoming more prevalent than GII in some areas towards the end of the study period (May 2021 – March 2022). Using relative strength indices (RSI), it was possible to study the trends of each genogroup, and total norovirus over time. Increases in norovirus levels appeared to coincide with the removal of COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions within England. Local Moran’s I analyses indicated several localised outbreaks of both GI and GII across England, notably the possible GI outbreak in the north of England in early 2022. Comparisons of national average norovirus concentrations in wastewater against concomitant norovirus reported case numbers showed a significant linear relationship. This highlights the potential for wastewater-based monitoring of norovirus as a valuable approach to support surveillance of norovirus in communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by His Majesty's Treasury Shared Outcome Fund via the PATH-SAFE programme.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Introduction People living with HIV (PLWH) can exhibit impaired immune responses to vaccines. Accumulating evidence indicates that PLWH, particularly those receiving antiretroviral therapy, mount strong antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination, but fewer studies have examined cellular immune responses to vaccination. We measured SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses generated by two and three doses of COVID-19 vaccine in PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy, compared to control participants without HIV. We also quantified T cell responses after post-vaccine breakthrough infection, and receipt of fourth vaccine doses, in a subset of PLWH.Methods We quantified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells reactive to overlapping peptides spanning the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 50 PLWH and 87 controls without HIV, using an activation induced marker (AIM) assay. All participants remained SARS-CoV-2 naïve until at least one month after their third vaccine dose. SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by seroconversion to nucleocapsid (N) antigen, which occurred in 21 PLWH and 38 controls post-third dose. Multivariable regression analyses were used to investigate relationships between sociodemographic, health and vaccine-related variables and vaccine-induced T cell responses, as well as breakthrough infection risk.Results A third vaccine dose boosted spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies significantly above those measured after the second dose (all p&lt;0.0001). Median T cell frequencies did not differ between PLWH and controls after the second dose (p&gt;0.1), but CD8+ T cell responses were modestly lower in PLWH after the third dose (p=0.02), an observation that remained significant after adjustment for sociodemographic, health and vaccine-related variables (p=0.045). In PLWH who experienced breakthrough infection, median T cell frequencies increased even higher than those observed after three vaccine doses (p&lt;0.03), and CD8+ T cell responses in this group remained higher even after a fourth vaccine dose (p=0.03). In multivariable analysis, the only factor associated with increased breakthrough infection risk was younger age, consistent with the rapid increases in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among younger adults in Canada after the initial appearance of the Omicron variant.Conclusion PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy mount strong T cell responses to COVID-19 vaccines that can be enhanced by booster doses or breakthrough infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada through a COVID-19 Immunology Task Force COVID-19 Hot Spots Award (2020-HQ-000120 to MGR, ZLB, MAB).

%T Immune history influences SARS-CoV-2 booster impacts: the role of efficacy and redundancy

%X Given the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern as well as unprecedented vaccine development, it is crucial to understand the effect of the updated vaccine formulations at the population level. While bivalent formulations have higher efficacy in vaccine trials, translating these findings to real-world effectiveness is challenging due to the diversity in immune history, especially in settings with a high degree of natural immunity. Known socioeconomic disparities in key metrics such as vaccine coverage, social distancing, and access to healthcare have likely shaped the development and distribution of this immune landscape. Yet little has been done to investigate the impact of booster formulation in the context of host heterogeneity. Using two complementary mathematical models that capture host demographics and immune histories over time, we investigated the potential impacts of bivalent and monovalent boosters in low– and middle-income countries (LMICs). These models allowed us to test the role of natural immunity and cross-protection in determining the optimal booster strategy. Our results show that to avert deaths from a new variant in populations with high immune history, it is more important that a booster is implemented than which booster is implemented (bivalent vs. monovalent). However, in populations with low preexisting immunity, bivalent boosters can become optimal. These findings suggest that for many LMICs – where acquiring a new vaccine stock may be economically prohibitive – monovalent boosters can still be implemented as long as pre-existing immunity is high.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by the World Health Organization.

%X Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, viral sequencing has documented 131 individual mutations in the viral spike protein across 48 named variants. To determine the ability of vaccine-mediated humoral immunity to keep pace with continued SARS-CoV-2 evolution, we assessed the neutralization potency of sera from 76 vaccine recipients collected after 2 to 6 immunizations against a comprehensive panel of mutations observed during the pandemic. Remarkably, while many individual mutations that emerged between 2020 and 2022 exhibit escape from sera following primary vaccination, few escape boosted sera. However, progressive loss of neutralization was observed across newer variants, irrespective of vaccine doses. Importantly, an updated XBB.1.5 booster significantly increased titers against newer variants but not JN.1. These findings demonstrate that seasonal boosters improve titers against contemporaneous strains, but novel variants continue to evade updated mRNA vaccines, demonstrating the need for novel approaches to adequately control SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Competing Interest StatementA.B.B. is a founder of Cure Systems LLC.Funding StatementA.B.B. was supported by NIAID R01s AI174875, AI174276, the NIDA Avenir New Innovator Award DP2DA040254 a Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogenesis Readiness (MassCPR) grant and CDC subcontract 200-2016-91773-T.O.2.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Use of human samples was approved by Partners Institutional Review Board (protocol 2020P002274) and the WCG Institutional Review Board (protocol 1316159)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The goal of any vaccine is to induce long-lived plasma cells (LLPC) to provide life-long protection. Natural infection by influenza, measles, or mumps viruses generates bone marrow (BM) LLPC similar to tetanus vaccination which affords safeguards for decades. Although the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines protect from severe disease, the serologic half-life is short-lived even though SARS-CoV-2-specific plasma cells can be found in the BM. To better understand this paradox, we enrolled 19 healthy adults at 1.5-33 months after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and measured influenza-, tetanus-, or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) in LLPC (CD19−) and non-LLPC (CD19+) subsets within the BM. All individuals had IgG ASC specific for influenza, tetanus, and SARS-CoV-2 in at least one BM ASC compartment. However, only influenza- and tetanus-specific ASC were readily detected in the LLPC whereas SARS-CoV-2 specificities were mostly excluded. The ratios of non-LLPC:LLPC for influenza, tetanus, and SARS-CoV-2 were 0.61, 0.44, and 29.07, respectively. Even in five patients with known PCR-proven history of infection and vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific ASC were mostly excluded from the LLPC. These specificities were further validated by using multiplex bead binding assays of secreted antibodies in the supernatants of cultured ASC. Similarly, the IgG ratios of non-LLPC:LLPC for influenza, tetanus, and SARS-CoV-2 were 0.66, 0.44, and 23.26, respectively. In all, our studies demonstrate that rapid waning of serum antibodies is accounted for by the inability of mRNA vaccines to induce BM LLPC.Competing Interest StatementFEL is the founder of Micro-Bplex, Inc., serves on the scientific board of Be Biopharma, is a recipient of grants from the BMGF and Genentech, Inc., and has served as a consultant for Astra Zeneca.

%X Accumulating evidence points to persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in immunocompromised individuals as a source of genetically divergent, novel lineages, generally characterised by increased transmissibility and immune escape. While intrahost evolutionary dynamics of the virus in chronically infected patients have been previously reported, existing knowledge is primarily based on samples obtained from the nasopharyngeal compartment. In this study, we investigate the intrahost evolution and genetic diversity that accumulated during a prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Omicron sublineage BF.7, estimated to have persisted for over one year in an immunosuppressed patient. Based on the sequencing of eight viral genomes collected from the patient at six time points, we identified 86 intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs), two indels, and a 362 bp deletion. Our analysis revealed distinct viral genotypes in the nasopharyngeal (NP), endotracheal aspirate (ETA), and bronchoalveolar (BAL) samples. Notably, while significant divergence was observed between NP and BAL samples, most of the iSNVs found in ETA samples were also detected in NP or BAL samples. This suggests that NP samples may not offer a comprehensive representation of the overall intrahost viral diversity. Nonsynonymous mutations were most frequent in the spike and envelope genes, along with loss-of-function mutations in ORF8, generated by a frameshift mutation and a large deletion detected in the BAL and NP samples, respectively. Using long-range PCR on SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced as part of routine surveillance, we validated that similar deletions causing ORF8 loss of function can be carried by SARS-CoV-2 during acute infection. Our findings not only demonstrate that the Omicron sublineage BF.7 can further diverge from its already exceptionally mutated state but also highlight that patients chronically infected with SARS-CoV-2 can develop genetically specific viral populations across distinct anatomical compartments. This provides novel insights into the intricate nature of viral diversity and evolution dynamics in persistent infections.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by the Region Wallone project WALGEMED (convention no. 1710180) and the FNRS (H.C.008.20).

%X In the realm of infectious disease control, accurate modeling of the transmission dynamics is pivotal. As human mobility and commuting patterns are key components of communicable disease spread, we introduce a novel travel time aware metapopulation model. Our model aims to enhance estimations of disease transmission. By providing more reliable assessments on the efficacy of interventions, curtailing personal rights or human mobility behavior through interventions can be minimized. The proposed model is an advancement over traditional compartmental models, integrating explicit transmission on travel and commute, a factor available in agent-based models but often neglected with metapopulation models.Our approach employs a multi-edge graph ODE-based (Graph-ODE) model, which represents the intricate interplay between mobility and disease spread. This granular modeling is particularly important when assessing the dynamics in densely connected urban areas or when heterogeneous structures across entire countries have to be assessed. The given approach can be coupled with any kind of ODE-based model.In addition, we propose a novel multi-layer waning immunity model that integrates waning of different paces for protection against mild and severe courses of the disease. As this is of particular interest for late-phase epidemic or endemic scenarios, we consider the late-phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany.The results of this work show that accounting for resolved mobility significantly influences the pattern of outbreaks. The improved model provides a refined tool for predicting outbreak trajectories and evaluating intervention strategies in relation to mobility by allowing us to assess the transmission that result on traveling. The insights derived from this model can serve as a basis for decisions on the implementation or suspension of interventions, such as mandatory masks on public transportation. Eventually, our model contributes to maintaining mobility as a social good while reducing exuberant disease dynamics potentially driven by travel activities.Author summary As human contacts and contact networks are key to the development and prediction of infectious disease spread, travel and commuting activities are important components to be considered in mathematical-epidemiological modeling. Two, often contrasting modeling approaches, based on subpopulations and based on individuals can provide insights of different granularity but also come at different levels of complexity.With this article, we extend a recently introduced Graph-ODE-based model by the explicit introduction of mobility-based infection models in which we allow focused nonpharmaceutical interventions, like face mask mandates in public transport, and in which we can explicitly keep track of secondary cases induced by travel activities, a component mostly not available with equation-based models. In addition, we introduce a novel multi-layer waning immunity model particularly suitable for late-phase epidemic or endemic scenarios.On a daily level and geographically small scale, the newly proposed model often develops similarly, although our results show that complex mobility networks can lead to substantially different disease dynamics in the entirety of a federal state or country. The proposed model thus enables a better understanding of infectious disease dynamics through mobility. It allows for targeted numerical investigations and thus leads to more appropriate real-world interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors HZ, RS, AS, and MJK have received funding by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport under grant agreement FKZ19F2211A, RS has received funding by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport under grant agreement FKZ19F2211B.

%X We focus on distinctive data-driven measures of the fate of ongoing epidemics. The relevance of our pursuit is suggested by recent results proving that the short-term temporal evolution of infection spread is described by an epidemicity index related to the maximum instantaneous growth rate of new infections, echoing concepts and tools developed to study the reactivity of ecosystems. Suitable epidemicity indices can showcase the dynamics of infections, together with commonly employed effective reproduction numbers, especially when the latter assume values less than 1. In particular, epidemicity evaluates the short-term reactivity to perturbations of a disease-free equilibrium. Here, we show that sufficient epidemicity thresholds to prevent transient epidemic outbreaks in a spatially connected setting can be estimated by generalizing existing analogues derived when spatial effects are neglected. We specifically account for the discrete nature, in both space and time, of surveillance data of the type typically employed to estimate effective reproduction numbers that formed the bulk of the communication of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic and its controls. After analyzing the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the considered prognostic indicators, we perform a short- and long-term analysis on the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, showing that endemic conditions were maintained throughout the duration of our simulation despite stringent control measures. Our method provides a portfolio of prognostic indices that are essential to pinpoint the ongoing pandemic in both a qualitative and quantitative manner, as our results demonstrate. We base our conclusions on extended investigations of the effects of spatial fragmentation of communities of different sizes owing to connectivity by human mobility and contact scenarios, within real geographic contexts and synthetic setups designed to test our framework.Author summary We revisit current standards in the characterization of the instantaneous state of epidemic spread in the light of newly acquired capabilities relaxing the assumption of spatially implicit disease geographies. Specifically, we generalize data-driven estimators of short-term epidemicity to include remotely acquired and objectively manipulated information about human mobility and the ensuing contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. Our results show that a spatial perspective can provide useful information on each node’s contribution to unfolding epidemics in connected systems. The level of heterogeneity that implies major departures among the key indicators, in particular epidemicity indices measuring the maximum growth rates of new infections (whose spatially explicit version is derived here), is identifiable and not unrealistic. Therefore, we suggest that only a portfolio of indicators based on epidemiological data (spatially implicit and explicit effective reproduction numbers and epidemicity indices that address the reactivity of the system) can provide a general, time-varying, and comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of epidemic control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementC.T., and A.R. acknowledge funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (https://www.snf.ch/en) via the project "Optimal control of intervention strategies for waterborne disease epidemics" (grant number 200021-172578).

%T Difference in TMPRSS2 usage by Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2: Implication for a sudden increase among children

%X It has been postulated from a combination of evidence that a sudden increase in COVID-19 cases among pediatric patients after onset of the Omicron wave was attributed to a reduced requirement for TMPRSS2-mediated entry in pediatric airways with lower expression levels of TMPRSS2. Epidemic strains were isolated from the indigenous population in an area, and the levels of TMPRSS2 required for Delta and Omicron variants were assessed. As a result, Delta variants proliferated fully in cultures of TMPRSS2-positive Vero cells but not in TMPRSS2-negative Vero cell culture (350-fold, Delta vs 9.6-fold, Omicron). There was no obvious age-dependent selection of Omicron strains affected by the TMPRSS2 (9.6-fold, Adults vs. 12-fold, Children). A phylogenetic tree was generated and Blast searches (up to 100 references) for the spread of strains in the study area showed that each strain had almost identical homology (&gt;99.5%) with foreign isolates, although indigenous strains had obvious differences from each other. This suggested that the differences had been present abroad for a long period. Therefore, the lower requirement for TMPRSS2 by Omicron strains might be applicable to epidemic strains globally. In conclusion, the property of TMPRSS2-independent cleavage makes Omicron proliferate with ease and allows epidemics among children with fewer TMPRSS2 on epithelial surfaces of the respiratory organs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementYesAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The present study was conducted with the approval and under the control of the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Japan (No.20A138).

%X Background The urgent need for safe, effective, and economical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, especially for booster campaigns targeting vulnerable populations, prompted the development of the AVX/COVID-12 vaccine candidate. AVX/COVD-12 is based in a Newcastle disease virus La Sota (NDV-LaSota) recombinant viral vector. This vaccine expresses a stabilized version of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), specifically the ancestral Wuhan strain. The study aimed to assess its safety, immunogenicity, and potential efficacy as an anti-COVID-19 booster vaccine.Methods In a phase II/III clinical trial conducted from November 9, 2022, to September 11, 2023, a total of 4,056 volunteers were enrolled. Participants received an intramuscular booster dose of either AVX/COVID-12 or AZ/ChAdOx-1-S vaccines. Safety, immunogenicity, and potential efficacy were assessed through various measures, including neutralizing antibody titers, interferon (IFN)-γ-producing CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells. The evaluation also involved immunobridging, utilizing the AZ/ChAdOx-1-S vaccine as an active comparator, and monitoring the incidence of COVID-19 cases.Findings The AVX/COVID-12 vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and the BA.2 and BA.5 Omicron variants. The geometric mean ratio of neutralizing antibody titers between individuals immunized with the AVX/COVID-12 vaccine and those with the AZ/ChAdOx-1-S vaccine at 14 days is 0.96, with a confidence interval (CI) of 0.85-1.06. The outcome aligns with the non-inferiority criterion recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), indicating a lower limit of the CI greater than or equal to 0.67. Induction of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells at day 14 post-immunization was exclusively observed in the AVX/COVID-12 group. Finally, a trend suggested a potentially lower incidence of COVID-19 cases in AVX/COVID-12 boosted volunteers compared to AZ/ChAdOx-1-S recipients.Conclusion The AVX/COVID-12 vaccine proved safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic. AVX/COVID-12 meets the WHO non-inferiority standard compared to AZ/ChAdOx-1-S. These results strongly advocate for AVX/COVID-12 as a viable booster dose, supporting its utilization in the population.Competing Interest StatementThe vaccine candidate administered in this study was developed by faculty members at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai including P.P., F.K. and A.G.-S.

%X Background The global inequity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine distribution, primarily affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), highlights the urgent need for innovative and cost-effective vaccine technologies to address availability disparities. This is crucial for achieving and sustaining widespread immunity and protecting vulnerable populations during future booster campaigns.Methods To address this need, we conducted a phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of the AVX/COVID-12 “Patria” vaccine as a booster dose. The vaccine was administered through both intramuscular (IM) and intranasal (IN) routes to participants who had previously received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines based on adenoviral technology, inactivated virus, or mRNA technology. The inclusion criterion involved individuals with initial anti-spike IgG titers below 1,200 U/mL, allowing observation of the booster effect induced by vaccination.Results Immunization with AVX/COVID-12 resulted in a significant (&gt;2.5 times) increase in neutralizing antibodies against the original Wuhan strain and variants of concern (VOCs) such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron (BA.2 and BA.5). This immune response was accompanied by cellular interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, indicating a robust and multifaceted reaction.Conclusions The administration of AVX/COVID-12 as a booster dose, whether through IM or IN routes, was safe and well-tolerated. The vaccine extended immune responses not only against the original Wuhan-1 strain but also against various VOCs. Its ability to enhance preexisting immune responses suggests a potential contribution to expanding and sustaining herd immunity within the population.Competing Interest StatementThe vaccine candidate administered in this study was developed by faculty members at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai including P.P., F.K., and A.G.-S. Mount Sinai is seeking to commercialize this vaccine; therefore, the institution and its faculty inventors could benefit financially. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-849 CoV-2 serological assays (USA Provisional Application Numbers: 62/994,252, 63/018,457, 63/020,503, and 63/024,436) and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (USA Provisional Application Number: 63/251,020) which list F.K. as co-inventor. A.G.-S. and P.P. are co-inventors in the NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine patent application. Patent applications were submitted by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai has spun out a company, Kantaro, to market serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 and another company, CastleVax, to commercialize SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. F.K., P.P., and A.G.-S. serve on the scientific advisory board of CastleVax and are listed as co-founders of the company. F.K. has consulted for Merck, Seqirus, Curevac, and Pfizer, and is currently consulting for Gritstone, Third Rock Ventures, GSK, and Avimex. The F.K. laboratory has been collaborating with Pfizer on animal models of SARS-CoV-2. C.L.-M. has consulted for AstraZeneca. The A.G.-S. laboratory has received research support from GSK, Pfizer, Senhwa Biosciences, Kenall Manufacturing, Blade Therapeutics, Avimex, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Dynavax, 7Hills Pharma, Pharmamar, ImmunityBio, Accurius, Nanocomposix, Hexamer, N-fold LLC, Model Medicines, Atea Pharma, Applied Biological Laboratories, and Merck.

%X This study compares the collection dates and locations of the Omicron BA.1 lineage and other major SARS-CoV- 2 mutants registered in NCBI GenBank and provides a detailed analysis of the emergence patterns of pure reverse mutants, which contain only reverse mutations and no other mutations in the surface glycoprotein. The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%T Mathematical assessment of the role of human behavior changes on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics

%X The COVID-19 pandemic has not only presented a major global public health and socio-economic crisis, but has also significantly impacted human behavior towards adherence (or lack thereof) to public health intervention and mitigation measures implemented in communities worldwide. The dynamic nature of the pandemic has prompted extensive changes in individual and collective behaviors towards the pandemic. This study is based on the use of mathematical modeling approaches to assess the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is impacted by population-level changes of human behavior due to factors such as (a) the severity of transmission (such as disease-induced mortality and level of symptomatic transmission), (b) fatigue due to the implementation of mitigation interventions measures (e.g., lockdowns) over a long (extended) period of time, (c) social peer-pressure, among others. A novel behavior-epidemiology model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is developed and fitted using observed cumulative SARS-CoV-2 mortality data during the first wave in the United States. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that its disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the control reproduction number (denoted by ℛC) is less than one, and the disease persists (i.e., causes significant outbreak or outbreaks) if the threshold exceeds one. The model fits the observed data, as well as makes a more accurate prediction of the observed daily SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the first wave (March 2020 -June 2020), in comparison to the equivalent model which does not explicitly account for changes in human behavior. Of the various metrics for human behavior changes during the pandemic considered in this study, it is shown that behavior changes due to the level of SARS-CoV-2 mortality and symptomatic transmission were more influential (while behavioral changes due to the level of fatigue to interventions in the community was of marginal impact). It is shown that an increase in the proportion of exposed individuals who become asymptomatically-infectious at the end of the exposed period (represented by a parameter r) can lead to an increase (decrease) in the control reproduction number (ℛC) if the effective contact rate of asymptomatic individuals is higher (lower) than that of symptomatic individuals. The study identifies two threshold values of the parameter r that maximize the cumulative and daily SARS-CoV-2 mortality, respectively, during the first wave. Furthermore, it is shown that, as the value of the proportion r increases from 0 to 1, the rate at which susceptible non-adherent individuals change their behavior to strictly adhere to public health interventions decreases. Hence, this study suggests that, as more newly-infected individuals become asymptomatically-infectious, the level of positive behavior change, as well as disease severity, hospitalizations and disease-induced mortality in the community can be expected to significantly decrease (while new cases may rise, particularly if asymptomatic individuals have higher contact rate, in comparison to symptomatic individuals).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Fulbright FellowshipAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The viral kinetics of documented SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit a high degree of inter-individual variability. We identified six distinct viral shedding patterns, which differed according to peak viral load, duration, expansion rate and clearance rate, by clustering data from 768 infections in the National Basketball Association cohort. Omicron variant infections in previously vaccinated individuals generally led to lower cumulative shedding levels of SARS-CoV-2 than other scenarios. We then developed a mechanistic mathematical model that recapitulated 1510 observed viral trajectories, including viral rebound and cases of reinfection. Lower peak viral loads were explained by a more rapid and sustained transition of susceptible cells to a refractory state during infection, as well as an earlier and more potent late, cytolytic immune response. Our results suggest that viral elimination occurs more rapidly during omicron infection, following vaccination, and following re-infection due to enhanced innate and acquired immune responses. Because viral load has been linked with COVID-19 severity and transmission risk, our model provides a framework for understanding the wide range of observed SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants R01AI169427 &amp; R01AI121129Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data analyzed in this work was previously published by Hay et al. and is available on github at https://github.com/gradlab/SC2-kinetics-immune-history.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The HIPRA-HH-2 was a multicentre, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority phase IIb clinical trial to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a heterologous booster with PHH-1V adjuvanted recombinant vaccine versus a homologous booster with mRNA vaccine. Interim results showed a strong humoral and cellular immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain and the Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 variants up to day 98 after dosing. Here we report that these humoral and cellular responses after PHH-1V dosing are sustained up to 6 months. These results are observed both when including or not participants who reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and in a high-risk population (≥65 years). Additional analysis revealed a non-inferiority of PHH-1V booster in eliciting neutralizing antibodies also for SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB.1.5 when compared to mRNA vaccine after 6 months. The PHH-1V vaccine provides long-lasting protection against a wide variety of SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants to prevent severe COVID-19.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05142553Competing Interest StatementThe authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: J Blanco has received institutional grants from HIPRA, Grifols, Nesapor Europe and MSD.

%X Wastewater can play a vital role in infectious disease surveillance, especially in underserved communities where it can reduce the equity gap to larger municipalities. However, using wastewater surveillance in a predictive manner remains a challenge. We tested if detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can predict outbreaks in rural communities. Under the CDC National Wastewater Surveillance program, we monitored several rural communities in Idaho (USA). While high daily variations in wastewater viral load made real-time interpretation difficult, a SEIR model could factor out the data noise and forecast the start of the Omicron outbreak in five of the six cities that were sampled soon after SARS-CoV-2 quantities increased in wastewater. For one city, the model could predict an outbreak 11 days before reported clinical cases began to increase. An epidemiological modeling approach can transform how epidemiologists use wastewater data to provide public health guidance on infectious diseases in rural communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number P20GM104420.

%X Immunological memory mediates rapid protection following infection or vaccination including heterologous exposure. However, cross-reactive memory responses in humans remain poorly characterized. We explored the longevity and specificity of cross-protective responses to orthopoxviruses through smallpox vaccination and Mpox virus (MPXV) infection. Smallpox vaccination using Vaccinia virus (VACV)-based vaccines provides a unique opportunity to study long-term cross-protective immunity without antigen re-exposure. We assessed systemic and mucosal responses in four human cohorts, including first-(Dryvax) and/or third-generation (JYNNEOS) smallpox vaccine recipients (vaccinated 1 week-80 years ago), along with Mpox-infected individuals. First-and third-generation smallpox vaccines elicited strong VACV- and MPXV-specific antibodies. VACV-neutralizing antibodies persisted for decades in first-generation vaccine recipients and were further enhanced after JYNNEOS vaccination. However, despite the high levels of anti-MPXV-specific antibodies in the plasma, cross-neutralization activity was directly correlated with the antigenic distance. Higher neutralization was observed for the cowpox virus (CWPXV) than for MPXV, which showed lower antigenic conservation with VACV. Similarly, Mpox-infected patients had lower neutralization titers for VACV than for CWPXV. Individuals who received vaccination boosters showed more robust, diverse, and prolonged cross-neutralizing responses. Long-term memory analysis revealed an increase in neutralization capacity for VACV over decades, with 80-years-old displaying the most robust humoral response, although this trend was not observed for cross-reactive antigens. Finally, T-cell reactivity to VACV and MPXV epitopes was detected decades post-vaccination, suggesting a role of long-lasting cross-reactive T-cell memory responses in vaccine efficacy. Our findings underscore the pivotal influence of antigenic distance on vaccine effectiveness with implications for cross-protective vaccine design.Competing Interest StatementAlessandro Sette is a consultant for Gritstone Bio, Flow Pharma, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Qiagen, Fortress, Gilead, Sanofi, Merck, RiverVest, MedaCorp, Turnstone, NA Vaccine Institute, Emervax, Gerson Lehrman Group and Guggenheim.

%X Since the onset of the global pandemic caused by the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020, numerous studies have been conducted worldwide to understand our immune response to the virus. This study investigates the humoral response elicited by vaccination and by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the poorly studied food and retail workers in the Québec City area. The 1.5-year study period spans from early 2021, when vaccination became available in this region, to mid-2022, following waves of virulence due to the emergence of the first Omicron variants. Cross-correlated with data on workplace protective measures, pre-existing conditions, activities and other potentially relevant factors, this longitudinal study applies recently developed ELISA data transformation to our dataset to obtain normal distribution. This unlocked the possibility to use the ANOVA-Welsh method for statistical analysis to obtain a statistical perspective of the serological response. Our work allows the identification of factors contributing to statistically relevant differences in the humoral response of the cohort and strengthens the utility of the use of decentralized approaches to serological analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada through the COVID‐19 Immunity Task Force (CITF) grant number 2021-HQ-000134.

%X Knowledge on the antibody response to inactivated vaccines in third dose is crucial because it is one of the primary global vaccination programs. This study integrated microsampling with optical biosensors to profile neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in fifteen vaccinated healthy donors, followed by application of machine learning to predict antibody response at given timepoints. Over a nine-month duration, microsampling and venipuncture were conducted at seven individual timepoints. A refined iteration of fiber optic-biolayer interferometry (FO-BLI) biosensor was designed, enabling rapid multiplexed biosensing of NAbs towards both wild-type and Omicron variants in minutes. Findings revealed a strong correlation (Pearson r of 0.919, specificity of 100%) between wild-type NAbs levels in microsamples and sera. Following the third dose, Sera NAbs levels for wide-type increased by 2.9-fold after seven days and 3.3-fold within a month, subsequently waning and becoming undetectable in three months. Considerable but incomplete escape of the latest omicron subvariants from booster vaccine elicited NAbs was confirmed, although a higher number of binding antibodies (BAbs) was identified by another rapid FO-BLI biosensor in minutes. Significantly, FO-BLI highly correlated with a pseudovirus neutralization assay in identifying neutralizing capacities (Pearson r of 0.983). Additionally, machine learning demonstrated exceptional accuracy in predicting antibody levels with an error of &lt;5% for both NAbs and BAbs across multiple timepoints. Microsample-driven biosensing enables individuals to access their results within hours after self-collection, while precise models could guide personalized vaccination strategies. The technology’s innate adaptability positions its potential for effective translation in diseases prevention and vaccines development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 82104122], the Research Center for Industries of the Future of Westlake University [Grant No. 210230006022219/001] and the Westlake University [Grant No. 10318A992001].Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was conducted with the ethic approval of both the Sir Run Run Shaw (SRRS) Hospital, School of Medicine Zhejiang University (research 20210706-7) and the Institutional Review Board of Westlake University (20210301BSM001).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X We sought to determine pre-infection correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccine infections (PVI) acquired during the first Omicron wave in the United States. Serum and saliva samples from 176 vaccinated adults were collected from October to December of 2021, immediately before the Omicron wave, and assessed for SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific IgG and IgA binding antibodies (bAb). Sera were also assessed for bAb using commercial assays, and for neutralization activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. PVI duration and severity, as well as risk and precautionary behaviors, were assessed by questionnaires. Serum anti-Spike IgG levels assessed by research assay, neutralization titers against Omicron subvariants, and low home risk scores correlated with protection against PVIs after multivariable regression analysis. Commercial assays did not perform as well as research assay, likely due to their lower dynamic range. In the 32 participants that developed PVI, anti-Spike IgG bAbs correlated with lower disease severity and shorter duration of illness.Competing Interest StatementS.D.P., T.H.B, and D.R.T. report that the USU IDCRP, a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Institution, and the HJF were funded under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to conduct an unrelated phase III COVID-19 monoclonal antibody immunoprophylaxis trial sponsored by AstraZeneca.

%X SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) circulated cryptically before being identified as a threat, delaying interventions. Here we studied the drivers of such silent spread and its epidemic impact to inform future response planning. We focused on Alpha spread out of the UK. We integrated spatio-temporal records of international mobility, local epidemic growth and genomic surveillance into a Bayesian framework to reconstruct the first three months after Alpha emergence. We found that silent circulation lasted from days to months and decreased with the logarithm of sequencing coverage. Social restrictions in some countries likely delayed the establishment of local transmission, mitigating the negative consequences of late detection. Revisiting the initial spread of Alpha supports local mitigation at the destination in case of emerging events.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is partially funded by: the Municipality of Paris through the programme Emergence(s) to C.P. and B.F.; the Agence Nationale de la Recherche project DATA REDUX (ANR 19 CE46 0008 03) to V.C.; ANRS Maladies Infectieuses Emergentes project EMERGEN (ANRS0151) to V.C.; EU Horizon 2020 grants MOOD (H2020 874850) to V.C., C.P., P.Y.B., M.U.G.K., P.L. and RECOVER (H2020- 101003589) to V.C.; the ERC grant EvoComBac 949208 to F.B.; ERC grant ReservoirDOCS 725422 to P.L.; Institut des Sciences du Calcul et de la Donnee (ISCD).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Rationale In the upper respiratory tract replicating (culturable) SARS-CoV-2 is recoverable for ∼ 4 to 8 days after symptom onset, however, there is paucity of data about the frequency or duration of replicating virus in the lower respiratory tract (i.e. the human lung).Objectives We undertook lung tissue sampling (needle biopsy), shortly after death, in 42 mechanically ventilated decedents during the Beta and Delta waves. An independent group of 18 ambulatory patents served as a control group.Methods Lung biopsy cores from decedents underwent viral culture, histopathological analysis, electron microscopy, transcriptomic profiling and immunohistochemistry.Results 38% (16/42) of mechanically ventilated decedents had culturable virus in the lung for a median of 15 days (persisting for up to 4 weeks) after symptom onset. Lung viral culture positivity was not associated with comorbidities or steroid use. Delta but not Beta variant lung culture positivity was associated with accelerated death and secondary bacterial infection (p&lt;0.05). Nasopharyngeal culture was negative in 23.1% (6/26) of decedents despite lung culture positivity. This, hitherto, undescribed bio-phenotype of lung-specific persisting viral replication was associated with an enhanced transcriptomic pulmonary pro-inflammatory response but with concurrent viral culture positivity.Conclusions Concurrent, rather than sequential active viral replication continues to drive a heightened pro-inflammatory response in the human lung beyond the second week of illness and was associated with variant-specific increased mortality and morbidity. These findings have potential implications for the design of interventional strategies and clinical management of patients with severe COVID-19 disease.Scientific Knowledge on the Subject Investigations to understand SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding (determined by PCR or antigen testing) have extensively focused on samples from the upper respiratory tract. The widely accepted view is that acute severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterised by a viral replicative phase in the first week of symptomatic illness followed by a pro-inflammatory immunopathologic phase peaking in the second and third weeks of illness. However, it remains unclear whether detection of SARS-CoV-2 beyond 2 weeks after symptom onset in published studies represent active replication competent virus because it may represent residual genomic or antigenic material in the tissue.What This Study Adds to the Field We have identified a, hitherto, undescribed bio-phenotype of acute severe COVID-19 characterised by persisting viral replication in the lung for up to 4 weeks after symptom onset. ∼40% of acute severe COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) decedents (n=42) had nasopharyngeal swab culture positivity at ∼2 weeks post-symptom onset versus only ∼5% in a group of ambulatory control patients (n=18). There was compartment-specific (nasopharynx versus lung) discordance. The phenotype of lung-specific persisting viral replication was associated with variant-specific accelerated death, an exaggerated inflammatory response, and attenuated T-cell immunity in the lung (based on histopathological and transcriptomic studies). This challenges the traditional view that viral replication occurs during the first 5 to 10 days of illness, which is followed by an effector or hyperinflammatory phase. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to systematically culture virus from the human lung and map out its related clinical determinants, and which describes the human lung transcriptomic profile of culture-positive versus culture-negative patients with severe COVID-19 disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was funded by the South African Medical Research Council.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the University of Cape Town (HREC approval number 866/2020) and University of Witwatersrand (HREC approval number M200313).

%X Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Childhood (MIS-C) follows SARS-CoV-2 infection and frequently leads to intensive care unit admission. The inability to rapidly discriminate MIS-C from similar febrile illnesses delays treatment and leads to misdiagnosis. To identify diagnostic discriminators at the time of emergency department presentation, we enrolled 104 children who met MIS-C screening criteria, 14 of whom were eventually diagnosed with MIS-C. Before treatment, we collected breath samples for volatiles and peripheral blood for measurement of plasma proteins and immune cell features. Clinical and laboratory features were used as inputs for a machine learning model to determine diagnostic importance. MIS-C was associated with significant changes in breath volatile organic compound (VOC) composition as well as increased plasma levels of secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2G2A) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP). In an integrated model of all analytes, the proportion of TCRVβ21.3+ non-naive CD4 T cells expressing Ki-67 had a high sensitivity and specificity for MIS-C, with diagnostic accuracy further enhanced by low sodium and high PLA2G2A. We anticipate that accurate diagnosis will become increasingly difficult as MIS-C becomes less common. Clinical validation and application of this diagnostic model may improve outcomes in children presenting with multisystem febrile illnesses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, Burroughs Welcome Fund, Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, and Canadian Institute for Health Research.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia gave ethical approval for this work.

%X Understanding and accurately estimating epidemiological delay distributions is important for public health policy. These estimates directly influence epidemic situational awareness, control strategies, and resource allocation. In this study, we explore challenges in estimating these distributions, including truncation, interval censoring, and dynamical biases. Despite their importance, these issues are frequently overlooked in the current literature, often resulting in biased conclusions. This study aims to shed light on these challenges, providing valuable insights for epidemiologists and infectious disease modellers.Our work motivates comprehensive approaches for accounting for these issues based on the underlying theoretical concepts. We also discuss simpler methods that are widely used, which do not fully account for known biases. We evaluate the statistical performance of these methods using simulated exponential growth and epidemic scenarios informed by data from the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone Ebola virus disease epidemic.Our findings highlight that using simpler methods can lead to biased estimates of vital epidemiological parameters. An approximate-latent-variable method emerges as the best overall performer, while an efficient, widely implemented interval-reduced-censoring-and-truncation method was only slightly worse. Other methods, such as a joint-primary-incidence-and-delay method and a dynamic-correction method, demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, although they have inherent limitations and may not be the best choice for more complex problems.Despite presenting a range of methods that performed well in the contexts we evaluated, residual biases persisted, predominantly due to the simplifying assumption that the distribution of event time within the censoring interval follows a uniform distribution; instead, this distribution should depend on epidemic dynamics. However, in realistic scenarios with daily censoring, these biases appeared minimal. This study underscores the need for caution when estimating epidemiological delay distributions in real-time, provides an overview of the theory that practitioners need to keep in mind when doing so with useful tools to avoid common methodological errors, and points towards areas for future research.What was known prior to this paperImportance of accurate estimates: Estimating epidemiological delay distributions accurately is critical for model development, epidemic forecasts, and analytic decision support.Right truncation: Right truncation describes the incomplete observation of delays, for which the primary event already occurred but the secondary event has not been observed (e.g. infections that have not yet become symptomatic and therefore not been observed). Failing to account for the right truncation can lead to underestimation of the mean delay during real-time data analysis.Interval censoring: Interval censoring arises when epidemiological events occurring in continuous time are binned into time intervals (e.g., days or weeks). Double censoring of both primary and secondary events needs to be considered when estimating delay distributions from epidemiological data. Accounting for censoring in only one event can lead to additional biases.Dynamical bias: Dynamical biases describe the effects of an epidemic’s current growth or decay rate on the observed delay distributions. Consider an analogy from demography: a growing population will contain an excess of young people, while a shrinking population will contain an excess of older people, compared to what would be expected from mortality profiles alone. Dynamical biases have been identified as significant issues in real-time epidemiological studies.Existing methods: Methods and software to adjust for censoring, truncation, and dynamic biases exist. However, many of these methods have not been systematically compared, validated, or tested outside the context in which they were originally developed. Furthermore, some of these methods do not adjust for the full range of biases.What this paper addsTheory overview: An overview of the theory required to estimate distributions is provided, helping practitioners understand the underlying principles of the methods and the connections between right truncation, dynamical bias, and interval censoring.Review of methods: This paper presents a review of methods accounting for truncation, interval censoring, and dynamical biases in estimating epidemiological delay distributions in the context of the underlying theory.Evaluation of methods: Methods were evaluated using simulations as well as data from the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone Ebola virus disease epidemic.Cautionary guidance: This work underscores the need for caution when estimating epidemiological delay distributions, provides clear signposting for which methods to use when, and points out areas for future research.Practical guidance: Guidance is also provided for those making use of delay distributions in routine practice.Key findingsImpact of neglecting biases: Neglecting truncation and censoring biases can lead to flawed estimates of important epidemiological parameters, especially in real-time epidemic settings.Equivalence of dynamical bias and right truncation: In the context of a growing epidemic, right truncation has an essentially equivalent effect as dynamical bias. Typically, we recommend correcting for one or the other, but not both.Bias in common censoring adjustment: Taking the common approach to censoring adjustment of naively discretising observed delay into daily intervals and fitting continuous-time distributions can result in biased estimates.Performance of methods: We identified an approximate-latent-variable method as the best overall performer, while an interval-reduced-censoring-andtruncation method was resource-efficient, widely implemented, and performed only slightly worse.Inherent limitations of some methods: Other methods, such as jointly estimating primary incidence and the forward delay, and dynamic bias correction, demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, but they also had inherent limitations depending on the setting.Persistence of residual biases: Residual biases persisted across all methods we investigated, largely due to the simplifying assumption that the distribution of event time within the primary censoring interval follows a uniform distribution rather than one influenced by the growth rate. These are minimal if the censoring interval is small compared to other relevant time scales, as is the case for daily censoring with most human diseases.Key limitationsDifferences between right censoring and truncation: We primarily focus on right truncation, which is most relevant when the secondary events are easier to observe than primary events (e.g., symptom onset vs. infection)—in this case, we can’t observe the delay until the secondary event has occurred. In other cases, we can directly observe the primary event and wait for the secondary event to occur (e.g., eventual recovery or death of a hospitalized individual)—in this case, it would be more appropriate to use right censoring to model the unresolved delays. For simplicity, we did not cover the right censoring in this paper.Daily censoring process: Our work considered only a daily interval censoring process for primary and secondary events. To mitigate this, we investigated scenarios with short delays and high growth rates, mimicking longer censoring intervals with extended delays and slower growth rates.Deviation from uniform distribution assumption: We show that the empirical distribution of event times within the primary censoring interval deviated from the common assumption of a uniform distribution due to epidemic dynamics. This discrepancy introduced a small absolute bias based on the length of the primary censoring window to all methods and was a particular issue when delay distributions were short relative to the censoring window’s length. In practice, other biological factors, such as circadian rhythms, are likely to have a stronger effect than the growth rate at a daily resolution. Nonetheless, our work lays out a theoretical ground for linking epidemic dynamics to a censoring process. Further work is needed to develop robust methods for wider censoring intervals.Temporal changes in delay distributions: The Ebola case study showcased considerable variation in reporting delays across the epidemic timeline, far greater than any bias due to censoring or truncation. Further work is needed to extend our methods to address such issues.Lack of other bias consideration: The idealized simulated scenarios we used did not account for observation error for either primary or secondary events, possibly favouring methods that do not account for real-world sources of biases.Limited distributions and methods considered: We only considered lognormal distributions in this study, though our findings are generalizable to other distributions. Mixture distributions and non-parametric or hazard-based methods were not included in our assessment.Exclusion of fitting discrete-time distributions: We focused on fitting continuous-time distributions throughout the paper. However, fitting discretetime distributions can be a viable option in practice, especially at a daily resolution. More work is needed to compare inferences based on discrete-time distributions vs continuous-time distributions with daily censoring.Exclusion of transmission interval distributions: Our work primarily focused on inferring distributions of non-transmission intervals, leaving out potential complications related to dependent events. Additional considerations such as shared source cases, identifying intermediate hosts, and the possibility of multiple source cases for a single infectee were not factored into our analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSF was supported by Wellcome Trust (210758/Z/18/Z).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Long COVID contributes to the global burden of disease. Proposed root cause hypotheses include the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral reservoir, autoimmunity, and reactivation of latent herpesviruses. Patients have reported various changes in Long COVID symptoms after COVID-19 vaccinations, leaving uncertainty about whether vaccine-induced immune responses may alleviate or worsen disease pathology.Methods In this prospective study, we evaluated changes in symptoms and immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination in 16 vaccine-naïve individuals with Long COVID. Surveys were administered before vaccination and then at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose of the primary series. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR enrichment, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, antibody responses to other viral and self-antigens, and circulating cytokines were quantified before vaccination and at 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination.Results Self-report at 12 weeks post-vaccination indicated 10 out of 16 participants had improved health, 3 had no change, 1 had worse health, and 2 reported marginal changes. Significant elevation in SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs and Spike protein-specific IgG were observed 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination. No changes in reactivities were observed against herpes viruses and self-antigens. Within this dataset, higher baseline sIL-6R was associated with symptom improvement, and the two top features associated with non-improvement were high IFN-β and CNTF, among soluble analytes.Conclusions Our study showed that in this small sample, vaccination improved the health or resulted in no change to the health of most participants, though few experienced worsening. Vaccination was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-specific IgG and T cell expansion in most individuals with Long COVID. Symptom improvement was observed in those with baseline elevated sIL-6R, while elevated interferon and neuropeptide levels were associated with a lack of improvement.Plain language summary The impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on vaccine-naïve individuals suffering from Long COVID is uncertain. This study assessed the experience and immune signatures of 16 unvaccinated participants with Long COVID. A total of 10 participants had improved health status after vaccination, and one person reported only worsening health. As expected, vaccination increased immune cells and antibodies against the viral spike protein. Immune signatures may prove to be predictors of health status after vaccination. However, given the small number of participants, these initial findings need further validation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocols https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.21.21260391v2.full Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by funds from Fred Cohen and Carolyn Klebanoff and by grants from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R01AI157488 to A.I.), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Collaborative COVID-19 Initiative (to A.I.), and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (to A.I.).

%X The spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to accumulate substitutions, leading to breakthrough infections of vaccinated individuals and prompting the development of updated booster vaccines. Here, we determined the specificity and functionality of antibody and B cell responses following exposure to BA.5 and XBB variants in individuals who received ancestral SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. BA.5 exposures elicited antibody responses that primarily targeted epitopes conserved between the BA.5 and ancestral spike, with poor reactivity to the XBB.1.5 variant. XBB exposures also elicited antibody responses that targeted epitopes conserved between the XBB.1.5 and ancestral spike. However, unlike BA.5, a single XBB exposure elicited low levels of XBB.1.5-specific antibodies and B cells in some individuals. Pre-existing cross-reactive B cells and antibodies were correlated with stronger overall responses to XBB but weaker XBB-specific responses, suggesting that baseline immunity influences the activation of variant-specific SARS-CoV-2 responses.HighlightsVariant breakthrough infections boost ancestral cross-reactive antibodies and B cellsFirst and second BA.5 exposures fail to elicit variant-specific antibodies and B cellsXBB infections and monovalent vaccinations elicit XBB.1.5-specific responses in some individualsXBB.1.5-specific responses correlate with low levels of pre-existing humoral immunityCompeting Interest StatementE.J.W. is a member of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.

%X To characterize Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission dynamics in each of the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) surrounding Dallas, Houston, New York City, and Phoenix in 2020 and 2021, we extended a previously reported compartmental model accounting for effects of multiple distinct periods of non-pharmaceutical interventions by adding consideration of vaccination and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7) and Delta (lineage B.1.617.2). For each MSA, we found region-specific parameterizations of the model using daily reports of new COVID-19 cases available from January 21, 2020 to October 31, 2021. In the process, we obtained estimates of the relative infectiousness of Alpha and Delta as well as their takeoff times in each MSA (the times at which sustained transmission began). The estimated infectiousness of Alpha ranged from 1.1x to 1.4x that of viral strains circulating in 2020 and early 2021. The estimated relative infectiousness of Delta was higher in all cases, ranging from 1.6x to 2.1x. The estimated Alpha takeoff times ranged from February 1 to February 28, 2021. The estimated Delta takeoff times ranged from June 2 to June 26, 2021. Estimated takeoff times are consistent with genomic surveillance data.One-Sentence Summary Using a compartmental model parameterized to reproduce available reports of new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, we quantified the impacts of vaccination and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7) and Delta (lineage B.1.617.2) on regional epidemics in the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) surrounding Dallas, Houston, New York City, and Phoenix.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the LDRD program at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study involves only openly available human data, which can be obtained from the GitHub repository maintained by The New York Times collecting Coronavirus (Covid-19) data in the United States (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), the Covid Act Now database collecting information about completed COVID-19 vaccinations (https://covidactnow.org/), and the COVID-19 vaccine tracker of the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper (https://data.democratandchronicle.com/covid-19-vaccine-tracker).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The recently detected Omicron BA.2.86 lineage contains more than 30 amino acid mutations relative to BA.2. Here, we identify the epitopes driving immune escape of BA.2.86 and its derivative JN.1 (BA.2.86 + S455L) lineage. We investigated the cross-reactive humoral immunity within a cohort of health care workers against Omicron BA.2.86 and JN.1 by employing pseudo-viral mutants. We demonstrate that BA.2.86 and especially JN.1 evaded neutralization by serum antibodies of fully vaccinated individuals. To discern the contribution of individual epitope mutations to immune escape, we constructed a library of 33 BA.2.86 mutants, each of which harbored a single revertant mutation going back to BA.2. This library was used in a reverse mutational scanning approach to define serum neutralization titers against each epitope separately. The mutations within the receptor binding domain (RBD) at position K356T and to a lesser extent the mutations N460K, V483Δ, A484K, and F486P enhanced the immune escape. More surprisingly, the mutation 16insMPLF within the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) and the mutation P621S in S1/S2 significantly contributed to antibody escape of BA.2.86. Upon XBB.1.5 booster vaccination, neutralization titers against JN.1 and BA.2.86 improved relative to all ancestral strains, and the residual immune escape was driven by mutations at positions 16insMPLF, Δ144Y, E544K, P621S, and A484K.Competing Interest StatementL.C-S. served as an advisor to Sanofi unrelated to this work.

%X Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vulnerability and mortality. COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risks of serious COVID-19 outcomes, but the impact of COVID-19 vaccines including their effectiveness and adverse effects in patients with diabetes are not well known yet. Here, we showed that 61.1% patients with type 2 diabetes, but not healthy controls, exhibited aggravated insulin resistance towards the booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, we showed that COVID-19 vaccination once a week also impaired insulin sensitivity in healthy mice after four weeks. We further showed that metformin, a common anti-diabetic medication, improved the impaired insulin signaling induced by COVID-19 vaccination in mice. This study suggests clinical implications for the close monitoring of glycemic control in diabetic patients after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and indicates the beneficial action of metformin in counteracting insulin signaling variations induced by COVID-19 vaccination in diabetic patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialChiCTR2300069830Funding StatementThis study was kindly supported by Health@InnoHK Initiative Fund from the Hong Kong SAR Government (ITC RC/IHK/4/7 to ZX.B.), Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2020B1111110003 to ZX.B.), NSFC Excellent Young Scientist Scheme (32322091 to HLX.W.), Innovation and Technology Support Programme from the Hong Kong SAR Government (ITS/058/22MS, to HLX.W.) and General Research Grants from the Hong Kong SAR Government (22104123, to HLX.W.).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The human study was approved by the Research Committee on the Use of Human and Animal Subjects in Teaching and Research at Hong Kong Baptist University (REC/22-23/0277) and registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300069830).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Using a multiple-measurement approach, we examined the real-world effectiveness of portable HEPA-air filtration devices (air cleaners) in a school setting.Methods We collected environmental (CO2, particle concentrations), epidemiological (absences related to respiratory infections), audio (coughing), and molecular data (bioaerosol and saliva samples) over seven weeks during winter 2022/2023 in two Swiss secondary school classes. Using a cross-over study design, we compared particle concentrations, coughing, and the risk of infection with vs without air cleaners.Results All 38 students (age 13−15 years) participated. With air cleaners, mean particle con-centration decreased by 77% (95% credible interval 63%−86%). There were no differences in CO2 levels. Absences related to respiratory infections were 22 without vs 13 with air cleaners. Bayesian modeling suggested a reduced risk of infection, with a posterior probability of 91% and a relative risk of 0.73 (95% credible interval 0.44−1.18). Coughing also tended to be less frequent (posterior probability 93%). Molecular analysis detected mainly non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses in saliva (50/448 positive), but not in bioaerosols (2/105 positive) or HEPA-filters (4/160). The detection rate was similar with vs without air cleaners. Spatiotemporal analysis of positive saliva samples identified several likely transmissions.Conclusions Air cleaners improved air quality, showed a potential benefit in reducing respiratory infections, and were associated with less coughing. Airborne detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses was rare, suggesting that these viruses may be more difficult to detect in the air. Future studies should examine the importance of close contact and long-range transmission, and the cost-effectiveness of using air cleaners.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Multidisciplinary Center for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Switzerland.

%X Background Few national-level studies have evaluated the impact of “hybrid” immunity (vaccination coupled with recovery from infection) from the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2.Methods From May 2020 to December 2022, we conducted serial assessments (each of ∼4000-9000 adults) examining SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within a mostly representative Canadian cohort drawn from a national online polling platform. Adults, most of whom were vaccinated, reported viral test–confirmed infections and mailed self-collected dried blood spots to a central lab. Samples underwent highly sensitive and specific antibody assays to spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens, the latter triggered only by infection. We estimated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence prior to the Omicron period and during the BA.1/1.1 and BA.2/5 waves. We assessed changes in antibody levels and in age-specific active immunity levels.Results Spike levels were higher in infected than in uninfected adults, regardless of vaccination doses. Among adults vaccinated at least thrice and infected more than six months earlier, spike levels fell notably and continuously for the nine months post-vaccination. By contrast, among adults infected within six months, spike levels declined gradually. Declines were similar by sex, age group, and ethnicity. Recent vaccination attenuated declines in spike levels from older infections. In a convenience sample, spike antibody and cellular responses were correlated. Near the end of 2022, about 35% of adults above age 60 had their last vaccine dose more than six months ago, and about 25% remained uninfected. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rose from 13% (95% CI 11-14%) before omicron to 78% (76-80%) by December 2022, equating to 25 million infected adults cumulatively. However, the COVID-19 weekly death rate during the BA.2/5 waves was less than half of that during the BA.1/1.1 wave, implying a protective role for hybrid immunity.Conclusions Strategies to maintain population-level hybrid immunity require up-to-date vaccination coverage, including among those recovering from infection. Population-based, self-collected dried blood spots are a practicable biological surveillance platform.Funding Funding was provided by the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Pfizer Global Medical Grants, and St. Michael’s Hospital Foundation.

%X BACKGROUND Persistent symptoms among some persons who develop COVID-19 has led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may, in some form or location, persist for long periods following acute infection. Several studies have shown data in this regard but are limited by non-representative and small study populations, short duration since acute infection, and lack of a true-negative comparator group to assess assay specificity.METHODS We evaluated adults with RNA-confirmed COVID-19 at multiple time points following acute infection (pandemic-era participants) and adults with specimens collected prior to 2020 (pre-pandemic era). Using once-thawed plasma, we employed the Simoa® (Quanterix) single molecule array detection platform to measure SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1, and nucleocapsid antigens.RESULTS Compared to 250 pre-pandemic participants who had 2% assay positivity, detection of any SARS-CoV-2 antigen was significantly more frequent among 171 pandemic-era participants at three different time periods in the post-acute phase of infection. The absolute difference in SARS-CoV-2 plasma antigen prevalence was +11% (95% CI: +5.0% to +16%) at 3.0-6.0 months post-onset of COVID-19; +8.7% (95% CI: +3.1% to +14%) at 6.1 to 10.0 months; and +5.4% (95% CI: +0.42% to +10%) at 10.1-14.1 months. Hospitalization for acute COVID-19 and, among the non-hospitalized, worse self-reported health during acute COVID-19 were associated with greater post-acute phase antigen detection.CONCLUSIONS Compared to uninfected persons, there is an excess prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals up to 14 months after acute COVID-19. These findings motivate an urgent research agenda regarding the short-term and long-term clinical manifestations of this viral persistence.Competing Interest StatementMJP reports consulting for Gilead Sciences and AstraZeneca, outside the submitted work.

%X Epidemiology based on the detection of pathogens in wastewater is extremely useful in providing information about a population’s health status. This study aimed to analyze and report the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the province of Tucumán, Argentina during the second and third surges of COVID-19 between April 2021 and March 2022. The study aimed to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, correlating it with clinically reported COVID-19 cases. Wastewater samples (n=72) were collected from 16 sampling points located in 3 cities of Tucumán (San Miguel de Tucumán, Yerba Buena y Banda del Río Salí). Detection of viral nucleocapsid markers (N1 gene) was carried out using one-step RT-qPCR. Viral loads were determined for each positive sample using a standard curve. A positive correlation (p&lt;0.05) was observed between viral load (copies/mL) and the clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during the sampling period in San Miguel de Tucumán. Our research findings provided a crucial insight into the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection during epidemic outbreaks. The implementation of wastewater monitoring has proven to be an invaluable epidemiological tool, facilitating early detection of potential surges in COVID-19 cases, and enabling a comprehensive tracking of the pandemic. Our study underscores the significance of incorporating SARS-CoV-2 genome-based surveillance as a standard practice which will contribute to anticipating any future spikes in infections.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNational Council of Research and Technology (CONICET) and Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Argentina (MINCyT) through PROGRAMA DE ARTICULACION Y FORTALECIMIENTO FEDERAL DE LAS CAPACIDADES EN CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA COVID-19.

%X Aims To monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA contamination in vehicles operating in England during the pandemic, to better understand transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on public transport.Methods and Results We collected 1,314 surface samples between December 2020 and April 2022 on trains and buses managed by five different transport operators. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was investigated through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on 197 (15%) of the 1,314 surfaces sampled, including seat head rests, handholds, and air extract grilles, but the levels of RNA recovered on those samples (median value of 23.4, inter-quartile range: 14.3-35.4, N gene copies per extraction) made the presence of infectious virus at the time of sampling extremely unlikely. However, detection rates varied over time with peaks broadly coinciding with times of high community transmission, suggesting that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 when travelling on public transport could create opportunities for transmission.Conclusion During the pandemic, and as in other public spaces, low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found on surfaces associated with public transport.Impact statement The results of this study will inform modelling approaches and the implementation of mitigation strategies to minimise the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses in public transport.Competing Interest StatementCatherine J.

%X Background We investigated the seropositivity rates of Sri Lankan children in a large island wide serosurvey, to determine the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants and the association with the vaccination and nutritional status to understand the likely impact of newer variants in Sri Lanka.Methods Using the WHO UNITY protocol, we recruited 5207 children, aged 10 to 20 years, representative of the 9 provinces of Sri Lanka, and assessed seropositive rates, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to BA.2.75 and XBB.1.5, in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Anthropometric measurements were taken to determine the association between nutrition status and antibody levels.Results 3111/3119 (99.7%) vaccinated and 2008/2088 (96.2%) of unvaccinated children, were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 2984/3111 (95.9%) of vaccinated children had ACE2 blocking antibodies above the cut-off threshold, compared to 1346/2008 (67.0%) of unvaccinated children. 27.2 % unvaccinated children had positive antibody responses to BA.2.75 and 30.7% to XBB.1.5, while 64.3% of vaccinated had a positive response to BA.2.75 and 43.1% to XBB.1.5. Vaccinated children had significantly higher titres of total antibodies, ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to XBB.1.5 and BA.2.75 than unvaccinated children. However, the vaccinated had significantly higher responses to BA.2.75 (p&lt;0.0001), than XBB.1.5. Unvaccinated children, with &lt;3rd BMI centile had significantly lower ACE2 blocking antibodies than other groups.Discussion The high seropositivity rates and antibody titres to SARS-CoV-2 variants in unvaccinated children, suggests that they are likely to have been infected more than once with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of lower antibody levels in undernourished children should be further investigated.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study has been supported by WHO Unity Studies, a global sero-epidemiological standardization initiative, with funding to WHO and the UK Medical Research Council.

%X Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), manifests as persistent and often debilitating symptoms enduring well beyond the initial COVID-19 infection. Presently, a specific diagnostic test or definitive biomarker set for confirming long COVID is lacking, relying instead on the protracted presence of symptoms post-acute infection. In this study, we examined 105 saliva samples (49 from children with long COVID and 56 controls), revealing significant alterations in salivary biomarkers. Pediatric long COVID exhibited increased oxidant biomarkers, decreased antioxidant, immune response, and stress-related biomarkers. Correlation analyses unveiled distinct patterns between biomarkers in long COVID and controls. Notably, a multivariate logistic regression pinpointed TOS, ADA2, total proteins, and AOPP as pivotal variables, culminating in a remarkably accurate predictive model distinguishing long COVID from controls. Furthermore, total proteins and ADA1 were instrumental in discerning between mild and severe long COVID symptoms. This research sheds light on the potential clinical utility of salivary biomarkers in diagnosing and categorizing the severity of pediatric long COVID. It also lays the groundwork for future investigations aimed at unraveling the prognostic value of these biomarkers in predicting the trajectory of long COVID in affected individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the grant 00006/COVI/20 to VM and MLC funded by Fundacion Seneca-Murcia, the Saavedra Fajardo contract 21118/SF/19 to SC funded by Fundacion Seneca-Murcia, the Juan de la Cierva-Incorporacion contract to SDT funded by Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia/AEI/FEDER.

%X Sero-monitoring provides context to the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and changes in population immunity following vaccine introduction. Here, we describe results of a cross-sectional hospital-based study of anti-spike seroprevalence in New York City (NYC) from February 2020 to July 2022, and a follow-up period from August 2023 to October 2023. Samples from 55,092 individuals, spanning five epidemiological waves were analyzed. Prevalence ratios (PR) were obtained using Poisson regression. Anti-spike antibody levels increased gradually over the first two waves, with a sharp increase during the 3rd wave coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in NYC resulting in seroprevalence levels &gt;90% by July 2022. Our data provide insights into the dynamic changes in immunity occurring in a large and diverse metropolitan community faced with a new viral pathogen and reflects the patterns of antibody responses as the pandemic transitions into an endemic stage.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%X BACKGROUND The COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) viral specific antibody levels that translate into recipient post-transfusion antibody levels sufficient to prevent disease progression is not defined.METHODS This secondary analysis correlated donor and recipient antibody levels to hospitalization risk among unvaccinated, seronegative CCP recipients within the outpatient, double blind, randomized clinical trial that compared CCP to control plasma. The majority of COVID-19 CCP arm hospitalizations (15/17, 88%) occurred in this unvaccinated, seronegative subgroup. A functional cutoff to delineate recipient high versus low post-transfusion antibody levels was established by two methods: 1) analyzing virus neutralization-equivalent anti-S-RBD IgG responses in donors or 2) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 anti-S-RBD IgG antibody was diluted by a factor of 21.3 into post-transfusion seronegative recipients from matched donor units. Viral specific antibody delivered approximated 1.2 mg. The high antibody recipients transfused early (symptom onset within 5 days) had no hospitalizations. A CCP recipient analysis for antibody thresholds correlated to reduced hospitalizations found a significant association with Fisher’s exact test between early and high antibodies versus all other CCP recipients (or control plasma) with antibody cutoffs established by both methods-donor virus neutralization-based cutoff: (0/85; 0% versus 15/276; 5.6%) p=0.03 or ROC based cutoff: (0/94; 0% versus 15/267; 5.4%) p=0.01.CONCLUSION In unvaccinated, seronegative CCP recipients, early transfusion of plasma units corresponding to the upper 30% of all study donors reduced outpatient hospitalizations. These high antibody level plasma units, given early, should be reserved for therapeutic use.Trial registration: NCT04373460FUNDING Defense Health Agency and others.Competing Interest StatementTG- Paid consultant and employee of Fenwal, a Fresenius Kabi company; AC- Scientific Advisory Board of Sabtherapeutics (cow-derived human immunoglobulins COVID-19 treatment and other infectious diseases) and Ortho Diagnostics Speakers Bureau; EB- member of the FDA Blood Products Advisory Committee, Abbot Laboratories, Grifols Diagnostic Solutions and Terumo BCT: personal fee for invited educational presentations; California Institute for Regenerative Medicine: Advisor.

%X Background The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. In August 2020, the Abbot BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Card test became available as a timely and affordable alternative for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing, but its performance may vary due to factors including timing and symptomatology. This study evaluates BinaxNOW diagnostic performance in diverse epidemiological contexts.Methods Using RT-PCR as reference, we assessed performance of the BinaxNOW COVID-19 test for SARS-CoV-2 detection in anterior nasal swabs from participants of two studies in Puerto Rico from December 2020 to May 2023. Test performance was assessed by days post symptom onset, collection strategy, vaccination status, symptomatology, repeated testing, and RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values.Results BinaxNOW demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 84.1% and specificity of 98.8%. Sensitivity peaked within 1–6 days after symptom onset (93.2%) and was higher for symptomatic (86.3%) than asymptomatic (67.3%) participants. Sensitivity declined over the course of infection, dropping from 96.3% in the initial test to 48.4% in testing performed 7–14 days later. BinaxNOW showed 99.5% sensitivity in participants with low Ct values (≤25) but lower sensitivity (18.2%) for participants with higher Cts (36–40).Conclusions BinaxNOW demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, particularly in early-stage infections and symptomatic participants. In situations where test sensitivity is crucial for clinical decision- making, nucleic acid amplification tests are preferred. These findings highlight the importance of considering clinical and epidemiological context when interpreting test results and emphasize the need for ongoing research to adapt testing strategies to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases and the Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [grant numbers U01CK000437 and U01CK000580 to V.R.A.].

%X Completion of a COVID-19 vaccination series during pregnancy effectively reduces COVID-19 hospitalization among infants less than 6 months of age. Elucidating the dynamics of transplacental transfer of maternal vaccine-induced antibodies, and their persistence in infants at 2, 6, 9 and 12 months, has implications for new vaccine development and timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy to optimize protection of the mother-infant dyad. We evaluated anti-COVID antibody IgG subclass, Fc-receptor binding profile, and activity against wild-type Spike and RBD, and five variants of concern (VOCs) in 153 serum samples from 100 unique infants. Maternal IgG1 and IgG3 responses persisted in 2- and 6-month infants to a greater extent than the other IgG subclasses, with highest persistence of antibodies that bind placental neonatal Fc-receptor as well as FcψR3A. Timing of maternal vaccination and fetal sex were drivers of antibody persistence in infants. Lowest persistence at 2 and 6 months was observed against the Omicron RBD-specific region. Maternal vaccine timing, placental Fc-receptor binding capabilities, antibody subclass, fetal sex, and VOC all impact the persistence of maternal vaccine-induced antibodies in infants up to 12 months.Competing Interest StatementThis work was supported in part by a research grant from the Investigator-Initiated Studies Program of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp (MISP 61299 to A.G.E.).

%X Virion-mediated outbreaks are imminent and despite rapid responses, they continue to cause adverse symptoms and death. Therefore, tunable, sensitive, high-throughput assays are needed to control future virion-mediated outbreaks. Herein, we developed a tunable in situ assay to selectively sort virions and infected host-derived extracellular vesicles (IHD-EVs) and simultaneously detect antigens and nucleic acids at a single-particle resolution. The Biochip Antigen and RNA Assay (BARA) enhanced sensitivities, enabling the detection of virions in asymptomatic patients, genetic mutations in single virions, and the continued long-term expression of virion-RNA in the IHD-EVs of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 patients. The BARA revealed highly accurate diagnoses by simultaneously detecting the spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid-encoding RNA on single SARS-CoV-2 virions in saliva and nasopharyngeal swab samples. Altogether, the single-particle detection of antigens and virion-RNA provides a tunable framework for the diagnosis, monitoring, and mutation screening of current and future outbreaks.Teaser The BARA enables antigenic and nucleic acid testing in single virions for unprecedented perspectives on viral diseasesCompeting Interest StatementE.R. and K.T.N. have filed a patent application for the BARATM technology.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants UG3/UH3TR002884 (E.R.) and U18TR003807 (E.R., L.J.L., P.P., K.W., &amp; I.L.).

%X Background and Objective People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) receiving B cell-depleting therapies have impaired antibody responses to vaccination. In a proportion of individuals, repeat vaccination against COVID-19 leads to seroconversion. We sought to describe the immune phenotype of pwMS on ocrelizumab, and identify clinical and immunological determinants of an effective vaccine response.Methods This was a single-centre, prospective cohort study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from pwMS receiving ocrelizumab (n = 38) pre and post administration of a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Immunogenicity was measured by T cell IFNγ ELISpot, antibody titres, and live virus neutralisation. Humoral immunity was benchmarked against pwMS receiving natalizumab (n = 15), and against a correlate of real-world protection (50% reduction in incidence of infection) from SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and omicron BA.5 variants. The peripheral immune phenotype was comprehensively assessed by flow cytometry, and potential clinical and phenotypic determinants of response to vaccination identified.Results Immune cell populations relevant to disease and vaccine response were altered in pwMS receiving ocrelizumab versus natalizumab treatment, including depleted CD20-expressing B cell, T cell and NK cell populations, and elevated CD27+CD38+ T cell and ‘NK8’ cell frequencies. Following a third vaccine dose, 51% of pwMS on ocrelizumab were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-domain IgG, and 25% and 14% met the threshold for effective neutralisation of live SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and omicron BA.5 virus, respectively. B cell frequency at the time of vaccination, but not time since ocrelizumab infusion, was positively correlated with antibody response, while a strong negative correlation was observed between CD56bright NK cell frequency and antibody response in the ocrelizumab group. In this exploratory cohort, CD3−CD20+ B cells (% of lymphocytes; OR=3.92) and CD56bright NK cells (% of NK cells; OR=0.94) were predictive of an effective neutralising antibody response in second dose non-responders (AUC: 0.98).Discussion Ocrelizumab treatment was associated with an altered immune phenotype, including recently described T cell and NK populations with potential roles in disease pathogenesis. However, seroconversion was severely impaired by ocrelizumab, and less than half of those who seroconverted following a third vaccine dose demonstrated effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral or omicron BA.5. B cell frequency was associated with an effective antibody response, while immunomodulatory CD56bright NK cells were identified as a potential negative determinant of response in those with inadequate B cell numbers. Immune phenotype rather than time since ocrelizumab infusion may help to stratify individuals for prophylaxis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialACTRN12623001249640Funding StatementThis work has received funding from The Hospital Research Foundation Group (outside of structured grant round) and the Health Services Charitable Gifts Board (HSCGB; project grant, 70-05-52-05-20).

%X The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an unprecedented global effort to understand and mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 in Western New York, integrating individual patient-level genomic sequencing data with a spatially informed agent-based disease Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) computational model. The integration of genomic and spatial data enables a multi-faceted exploration of the factors influencing the transmission patterns of COVID-19, including population density, movement dynamics, and genetic variations in the viral genomes replicating in New York State (NYS). Our findings shed light on local dynamics of the pandemic, revealing potential hotspots of transmission. Additionally, the genomic analysis provides insights into the genetic heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 within a single lineage at a region-specific level. This interdisciplinary approach, bridging genomics and spatial modeling, contributes to a more holistic understanding of COVID-19 dynamics. The results of this study have implications for future public health strategies, guiding targeted interventions and resource allocation to effectively control the spread of similar viruses in the Western New York region.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was initially funded by a State University of New York Research Foundation pilot project award (COVID202044) to J.A.S.

%X Background Previous studies indicate a protective role for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination against development of pulmonary post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC). We compared clinical, imaging, histopathology and ultrastructural features of pulmonary PASC with and without prior vaccination in a consecutive cohort of 54 unvaccinated, 17 partially vaccinated and 28 fully vaccinated patients who presented with dyspnea on exertion after mild COVID-19 (without hospitalization).Methods Patients underwent full clinical evaluation including autoantibody (ANA/ENA) serology, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), bronchioloalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) analysis and transbronchial biopsy followed by histopathological and ultrastructural analysis and SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry.Results While vaccinated patients were younger (p=0.0056), included more active smokers (p=0.0135) and a longer interval since infection (35 vs. 17 weeks, p=0.0002), dyspnea on exertion and impaired lung function were not different between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Ground glass opacities in HRCT and centrilobular fibrosis were more frequent in unvaccinated patients (p=0.0154 and p=0.0353), but presence of autoantibodies, BAL lymphocytosis and bronchiolitis were common findings in all groups. While vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a longer time span between infection and consultation along with a reduced frequency of ground glass opacities and centrilobular fibrosis, impaired lung function, bronchiolitis and presence of autoantibodies are comparable between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Residual virus was not detected in lung tissue in all but 1 patient.Conclusion While differences between the investigated groups with regard to age, smoking status and SARS-CoV-2 variants have to be taken into account, a proposed protective role of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination against pulmonary PASC is so far not fully explained by clinical and histopathology findings.KEY MESSAGES The role of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the protection against pulmonary post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is unclear. Using a multidimensional approach integrating clinical, serological, imaging and histopathology data as well as ultrastructural analyses, we show here that previous vaccination has no impact on lung function, bronchiolitis or the detection of autoantibodies or residual virus in a previously healthy cohort of 99 PASC patients after mild COVID-19. While a higher frequency of ground glass opacities in unvaccinated patients might be due to the longer interval between infection and consultation, the observed fibrotic remodeling should prompt further investigation of a possible pro-fibrotic role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung.Competing Interest StatementDG and KS were speakers for Boehringer-Ingelheim.

%X Postexposure vaccination has the potential to prevent or modify the course of clinical disease among those exposed to a pathogen. However, due to logistical constraints, postexposure vaccine trials have been difficult to implement in practice. In place of trials, investigators have used observational data to estimate the effectiveness or optimal timing window for postexposure vaccines, but the relationship between these analyses and those that would be conducted in a trial is often unclear. Here, we define several possible target trials for postexposure vaccination and show how, under certain conditions, they can be emulated using observational data. We emphasize the importance of the incubation period and the timing of vaccination in trial design and emulation. As an example, we specify a protocol for postexposure vaccination against mpox and provide a step-by-step description of how to emulate it using data from a healthcare database or contact tracing program. We further illustrate some of the benefits of the target trial approach through simulation.Competing Interest StatementIn the past 24 months, ML has received grant support from Pfizer and consulting income from Janssen.

%X Background Production of affordable coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in low- and lower-middle-income countries is needed. NDV-HXP-S is an inactivated egg-based recombinant Newcastle disease virus vaccine expressing the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A public sector manufacturer in Vietnam assessed the immunogenicity of NDV-HXP-S (COVIVAC) relative to an authorized vaccine.Methods This phase 2 stage of a randomised, observer-blind, controlled, phase 1/2 trial was conducted at three community health centers in Thai Binh Province, Vietnam. Healthy males and non-pregnant females, 18 years of age and older, were eligible. Participants were randomised by age (18-59, ≥60 years) to receive one of three treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28 days apart: COVIVAC at 3 µg or 6 µg, or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine VAXZEVRIA. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The main outcome was the induction of 50% neutralising antibody titers against vaccine-homologous pseudotyped virus 14 days (day 43) and 6 months (day 197) after the second vaccination by age group. The primary immunogenicity and safety analyses included all participants who received one dose of the vaccine. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05940194.Findings During August 10-23, 2021, 737 individuals were screened, and 374 were randomised (124-125 per group); all received dose one, and three missed dose two. On day 43, the geometric mean fold rise of 50% neutralising antibody titers for subjects age 18-59 years was 31·20 (COVIVAC 3 μg N=82, 95% CI 25·14-38·74), 35·80 (COVIVAC 6 μg; N=83, 95% CI 29·03-44·15), 18·85 (VAXZEVRIA; N=82, 95% CI 15·10-23·54), and for subjects age ≥60 years was 37·27 (COVIVAC 3 μg; N=42, 95% CI 27·43-50·63), 50·10 (COVIVAC 6 μg; N=40, 95% CI 35·46-70·76), 16·11 (VAXZEVRIA; N=40, 95% CI 11·73-22·13). Among subjects seronegative for anti-S IgG at baseline, the day 43 geometric mean titer ratio of neutralising antibody (COVIVC 6 μg/VAXZEVRIA) was 1·77 (95% CI 1·30-2·40) for subjects age 18-59 years and 3·24 (95% CI 1·98-5·32) for subjects age ≥60 years. On day 197, the age-specific ratios were 1·11 (95% CI 0·51-2·43) and 2·32 (0·69-7·85). Vaccines were well tolerated; reactogenicity was predominantly mild and transient. The percentage of subjects with unsolicited adverse events (AEs) during 28 days after vaccinations was similar among treatments (COVIVAC 3 μg 29·0%, COVIVAC 6 μg 23·2%, VAXZEVRIA 31·2%); no vaccine-related AE was reported.Interpretation Considering that induction of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been correlated with the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, including VAXZEVRIA, our results suggest that vaccination with COVIVAC may afford clinical benefit matching or exceeding that of the VAXZEVRIA vaccine.Funding Vietnam’s Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (including support from Vietnam’s national COVID-19 vaccine fund and a charitable contribution from the Thien Tam fund of Vin group), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a charitable contribution from Bayer AG, US National Institutes of Health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialClinical trial ID NCT05940194Clinical Protocols https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05940194?term=NCT05940194&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 Funding StatementWork at Mount Sinai was supported by philanthropic donations to Mount Sinai/institutional funding (C-VaRPP funding).

%X Near-term forecasting of infectious disease incidence and consequent demand for acute healthcare services can support capacity planning and public health responses. Despite well-developed scenario modelling to support the Covid-19 response, Aotearoa New Zealand lacks advanced infectious disease forecasting capacity. We develop a model using Aotearoa New Zealand’s unique Covid-19 data streams to predict reported Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and hospital occupancy. The method combines a semi-mechanistic model for disease transmission to predict cases with Gaussian process regression models to predict the fraction of reported cases that will require hospital treatment. We evaluate forecast performance against out-of-sample data over the period from 2 October 2022 to 23 July 2023. Our results show that forecast performance is reasonably good over a 1-3 week time horizon, although generally deteriorates as the time horizon is lengthened. The model has been operationalised to provide weekly national and regional forecasts in real-time. This study is an important step towards development of more sophisticated situational awareness and infectious disease forecasting tools in Aotearoa New Zealand.Author summary The emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic has ended, but Covid-19 continues to put significant additional load on stretched healthcare systems. Forecasting the number of hospital cases caused an infectious disease like Covid-19 over the next few weeks can help with effective planning and response. The ability to forecast reliably requires timely, high-quality data and accurate mathematical models. We have developed a model for forecasting the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations in Aotearoa New Zealand. The model works in two stages: firstly predicting the number of new cases and secondly estimating the proportion of those cases that will need hospital treatment. The model produces a range of likely values, which is important because is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy. We show that the model does a reasonably good job of predicting hospitalisations up to 3 weeks ahead. The model has been used by public health agencies in Aotearoa New Zealand to help with healthcare capacity planning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the New Zealand Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Ministry of Health.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The New Zealand Ministry of Health waived ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Meaningful metrics of antiviral activity are essential for determining the efficacy of therapeutics in human clinical trials. Molnupiravir (MOV) is a broadly acting antiviral nucleoside analog prodrug that acts as a competitive alternative substrate for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an assay, Culture-PCR, to better understand the impact of MOV therapy on infectious SARS-CoV-2. Culture-PCR revealed MOV eliminated infectious virus within 48 hours in the nasopharyngeal compartment, the upper airway location with the greatest levels of infectious virus. MOV therapy was associated with increases in mutations across the viral genome but select regions were completely unaffected, thus identifying regions where mutation likely abrogates infectivity. MOV therapy did not alter the magnitude or neutralization capacity of the humoral immune response, a documented correlate of protection. Thus, we provide holistic insights into the function of MOV in adults with COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementK.R.M. has received grant support from Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Gilead Sciences.

%X Unlike genomic data, serological data have not been previously leveraged to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulation. In Bolivia, sustained genomic surveillance capacities were lacking especially at the beginning of the pandemic. In 2021 and 2022 we estimated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Bolivian blood donors and explored the feasibility of using virus serum neutralization data for variants thought to have circulated to map their circulation across all departments over a year-long follow-up period. Anti-S1 and anti-NCP SARS-CoV-2 IgGs were studied, along with virus neutralization tests for ancestral-D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Between 2021 and 2022, the overall prevalence of anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies increased reaching values over 90%, demonstrating that a large proportion of the Bolivian population was no longer naïve to the virus. Viral neutralization data, analyzed through multiple approaches, revealed the spread of the Gamma variant up to 2021, particularly impacting northern departments. In 2022, Gamma continued to circulate in southernmost departments of the country and the emergence of Omicron BA.1 was detected. These trends align with publicly available genomic data from neighboring countries. Our serological analyses successfully identified both new antigenic groups, such as Omicron BA.1, and individual variants related to previously circulating groups, such as Delta. The study contributes insights into overall population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and variant-specific immunity levels across different regions of Bolivia. It also emphasizes the potency of seroprevalence studies in informing public health decisions and underscore their value in capturing the initial phases of emerging epidemics when variant diversity is limited, facilitating timely genomic surveillance setup.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD), the project EMERGEN-PRI #22275 of the ANRS I MIE (INSERM), and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (European Virus Archive Global, grant agreement No. 871029).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of the Dr. Mario Ortiz Suarez hospital, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia (Number FWA0002686) and the National Blood Program from the Ministry of Health and Sports of Bolivia gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Repeated population-based SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance is key in complementing other surveillance tools.Aim Assessing trends in infection- and/or vaccine-induced immunity, including breakthrough infections, among (sub)groups and regions in the Dutch population during the Variant of Concern (VOC)-era whilst varying levels of stringency, to evaluate population immunity dynamics and inform future pandemic response planning.Methods In this prospective population-based cohort, randomly-selected participants (n=9,985) aged 1-92 years (recruited since early-2020) donated home-collected fingerstick blood samples at six timepoints in 2021-2022, covering waves dominated by Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.5). IgG antibody assessments against Spike-S1 and Nucleoprotein were combined with vaccination- and testing data to estimate infection-induced (inf) and total (infection- and vaccination-induced) seroprevalence.Results In 2021, nationwide inf-seroprevalence rose modestly from 12% since Alpha to 26% amidst Delta, while total seroprevalence increased rapidly to nearly 90%, particularly fast in vulnerable groups (i.e., elderly and those with comorbidities). Highest infection rates were noticeable in adolescents and young adults, low/middle educated elderly, non-Western, contact professions (other than healthcare), and low-vaccination coverage regions. In 2022, following Omicron emergence, inf-seroprevalence elevated sharply to 62% and further to 86%, with frequent breakthrough infections and reduction of seroprevalence dissimilarities between most groups. Whereas &gt;90% of &lt;60-year-olds had been infected, 30% of vaccinated vulnerable individuals had not acquired hybrid immunity.Conclusion Although total SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence had increased rapidly, infection rates were unequally distributed within the Dutch population. Ongoing tailored vaccination efforts and (sero-)monitoring of vulnerable groups remain important given their lowest rate of hybrid immunity and highest susceptibility to severe disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) in the Netherlands.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Medical Research Ethics Committees United (MEC-U) in the Netherlands approved the study, conformed to the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants provided written informed consent.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%T Testing-isolation interventions will likely be insufficient to contain future novel disease outbreaks

%X When novel human diseases emerge into naive populations, identification and isolation of infected individuals forms the first line of defense against the invading pathogens1,2. Diagnostic testing plays a critical role3,4, but health agencies unprepared for a novel disease invasion may struggle to meet the massive testing capacities demanded by an epidemic outbreak5, potentially resulting in a failure of epidemic containment as with COVID-196. What factors make a disease controllable versus uncontrollable with limited testing supplies remains unclear. Specifically, is the failure of testing-isolation unique to COVID-19, or is this a likely outcome across the spectrum of disease traits that may constitute future epidemics? Here, using a generalized mathematical disease model parameterized for each of seven different human diseases, we show that testing-isolation strategies will typically fail to contain epidemic outbreaks at practicably achievable testing capacities. From this analysis, we identify three key disease characteristics that govern controllability under resource constraints; the basic reproduction number, mean latent period, and non-symptomatic transmission index. Interactions among these characteristics play prominent roles in both explaining controllability differences among diseases and enhancing the efficacy of testing-isolation in combination with transmission-reduction measures. This study provides broad guidelines for managing controllability expectations during future novel disease invasions, describing which classes of diseases are most amenable to testing-isolation strategies alone and which will necessitate additional transmission-reduction measures like social distancing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by the Center of Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS) which is financed by Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and by the Saxon Ministry for Science, Culture and Tourism (SMWK) with tax funds on the basis of the budget approved by the Saxon State Parliament. The University of Maryland supported the efforts of SP and WFF.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background We report the safety and immunogenicity of fractional and full dose Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2 in an open label phase 2 trial of participants previously vaccinated with a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, with 91.4% showing evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.Methods A total of 286 adults (with or without HIV) were enrolled &gt;4 months after an Ad26.COV2.S prime and randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either a full or half-dose booster of Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccine. B cell responses (binding, neutralization and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity-ADCC), and spike-specific T-cell responses were evaluated at baseline, 2, 12 and 24 weeks post-boost. Antibody and T-cell immunity targeting the Ad26 vector was also evaluated.Results No vaccine-associated serious adverse events were recorded. The full- and half-dose BNT162b2 boosted anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody levels (3.9- and 4.5-fold, respectively) and neutralizing antibody levels (4.4- and 10-fold). Binding and neutralizing antibodies following half-dose Ad26.COV2.S were not significantly boosted. Full-dose Ad26.COV2.S did not boost binding antibodies but slightly enhanced neutralizing antibodies (2.1-fold). ADCC was marginally increased only after a full-dose BNT162b2. T-cell responses followed a similar pattern to neutralizing antibodies. Six months post-boost, antibody and T-cell responses had waned to baseline levels. While we detected strong anti-vector immunity, there was no correlation between anti-vector immunity in Ad26.COV2.S recipients and spike-specific neutralizing antibody or T-cell responses post-Ad26.COV2.S boosting.Conclusion In the context of hybrid immunity, boosting with heterologous full- or half-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine demonstrated superior immunogenicity 2 weeks post-vaccination compared to homologous Ad26.COV2.S, though rapid waning occurred by 12 weeks post-boost.Trial Registration South African National Clinical Trial Registry (SANCR): DOH-27-012022-7841Funding South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) and South African Department of Health (SA DoH).Competing Interest StatementI have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: A.Se. is a consultant for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Calyptus Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Darwin Health, EmerVax, EUROIMMUN, F.

%X Background There are many COVID-19 vaccines currently available, however, Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) still have large proportions of their populations unvaccinated. Decision-makers must decide how to effectively allocate available vaccines (e.g. boosters or primary series vaccination, which age groups to target) but LMIC often lack the resources to undergo quantitative analyses of vaccine allocation, resulting in adhoc policies. We developed Covid19Vaxplorer (https://covid19vaxplorer.fredhutch.org/), a free, user-friendly online tool that simulates region-specific COVID-19 epidemics in conjunction with vaccination with the purpose of providing public health officials worldwide with a tool for vaccine allocation planning and comparison.Methods We developed an age-structured mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 vaccination. The model considers vaccination with up to three different vaccine products, primary series and boosters. We simulated partial immunity derived from waning of natural infection and vaccination. The model is embedded in an online tool, Covid19Vaxplorer that was optimized for its ease of use. By prompting users to fill information through several windows to input local parameters (e.g. cumulative and current prevalence), epidemiological parameters (e.g basic reproduction number, current social distancing interventions), vaccine parameters (e.g. vaccine efficacy, duration of immunity) and vaccine allocation (both by age groups and by vaccination status). Covid19Vaxplorer connects the user to the mathematical model and simulates, in real time, region-specific epidemics. The tool then produces key outcomes including expected numbers of deaths, hospitalizations and cases, with the possibility of simulating several scenarios of vaccine allocation at once for a side-by-side comparison.Results We provide two usage examples of Covid19Vaxplorer for vaccine allocation in Haiti and Afghanistan, which had as of Spring 2023 2% and 33% of their populations vaccinated, and show that for these particular examples, using available vaccine as primary series vaccinations prevents more deaths than using them as boosters. Covid19Vaxplorer allows users in 183 regions in the world to compare several vaccination strategies simultaneously, adjusting parameters to their local epidemics, infrastructure and logistics. Covid19Vaxplorer is an online, free, user-friendly tool that facilitates evidence-based decision making for vaccine distribution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.2210382.

%X Both viral infection and vaccination affect the antibody repertoire of a person. Here we demonstrate that the analysis of serum antibodies carries information not only on the virus type that caused the infection, but also on the specific virus variant. We developed a rapid multiplex assay providing a fingerprint of serum antibodies against five different SARS-CoV-2 variants, based on a microarray of virus antigens immobilized on the surface of a label-free reflectometric biosensor. We analyzed serum from plasma of convalescent subjects and vaccinated volunteers and extracted individual antibody profiles of both total immunoglobulin Ig and IgA fraction. We found that Ig level profiles were strongly correlated with the specific variant of infection or vaccination and that vaccinated subjects displayed larger quantity of total Ig and lower fraction of IgA relative to the population of convalescent unvaccinated subjects.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was funded by Ministero Universita e Ricerca through grants FISR 2020 COVID, VIAEREA project No. FISR2020IP-04633, PRIN 2017, project No. 2017Z55KCW, Erogazione liberale per le attivita di ricerca sul Coronavirus, No. LIBVT20COVID19SEPIS and Fondazione Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi No. LIBVT21BAND.

%X The repeated COVID-19 outbreaks, despite global vaccination, highlights the need for booster doses. Here, we present the outcomes, up until day 90 post vaccination, of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of the mRNA-based vaccine candidate; COReNAPCIN®, as a booster dose in adults aged 18-50 who had previously received three doses of inactivated vaccines. In the study, 30 participants randomly (2:2:1) received 25 μg, or 50 μg of COReNAPCIN®, or placebo. The results indicated that COReNAPCIN® was well tolerated in vaccinated individuals in both groups with no life-threatening or other serious adverse events. The most noticeable solicited adverse events were pain at the site of injection, fatigue and myalgia. Regarding the immunogenicity, given the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies due to the vaccination history for all, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection for some participants, the recipients of COReNAPCIN®, two weeks post vaccination, showed significant fold increases in the level of anti-RBD (6.6 and 8.1 folds) or anti-spike (11.5 and 21.7 folds), and potent neutralizing antibodies (10.2 and 8.4 folds) in 25 and 50 μg groups, respectively, while no meaningful changes were observed in the placebo group. Additionally, the significant increase in the spike-specific IFN-γ T-cell response upon vaccination, underscores the activation of cellular immunity. Altogether, the favorable safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profile of COReNAPCIN® support its further clinical development.Trial registration number IRCT20230131057293N1Competing Interest StatementThe authors V.K., and S.D. are management board member and employees at ReNAP Therapeutics.

%X Innovative methods for evaluating virus risk and spread, independent of test-seeking behavior, are needed to improve routine public health surveillance, outbreak response, and pandemic preparedness. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental surveillance strategies, including wastewater and air sampling, have been used alongside widespread individual-based SARS-CoV-2 testing programs to provide population-level data. These environmental surveillance strategies have predominantly relied on pathogen-specific detection methods to monitor viruses through space and time. However, this provides a limited picture of the virome present in an environmental sample, leaving us blind to most circulating viruses. In this study, we explore whether pathogen-agnostic deep sequencing can expand the utility of air sampling to detect many human viruses. We show that sequence-independent single-primer amplification sequencing of nucleic acids from air samples can detect common and unexpected human respiratory and enteric viruses, including influenza virus type A and C, respiratory syncytial virus, human coronaviruses, rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, rotavirus, mamastrovirus, and astrovirus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was made possible by financial support through the National Institutes of Health grant (AAL4371).

%X Many studies have used mobile device location data to model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, yet relationships between mobility behavior and endemic respiratory pathogens are less understood. We studied the impacts of human mobility on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and 16 endemic viruses in Seattle over a 4-year period, 2018-2022. Before 2020, school-related foot traffic and large-scale population movements preceded seasonal outbreaks of endemic viruses. Pathogen circulation dropped substantially after the initiation of stay-at-home orders in March 2020. During this period, mobility was a positive, leading indicator of transmission of all endemic viruses and lagged SARS-CoV-2 activity. Mobility was briefly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when restrictions relaxed in summer 2020 but associations weakened in subsequent waves. The rebound of endemic viruses was heterogeneously timed but exhibited stronger relationships with mobility than SARS-CoV-2. Mobility is most predictive of respiratory virus transmission during periods of dramatic behavioral change, and, to a lesser extent, at the beginning of epidemic waves.Teaser: Human mobility patterns predict the transmission dynamics of common respiratory viruses in pre- and post-pandemic years.Competing Interest StatementCH received personal fees from Sanofi outside the submitted work.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 XBB is a group of highly immune-evasive lineages of the Omicron VOC that emerged by recombining BA.2-descendent lineages and spread worldwide during 2023. In this study, we combine SARS-CoV-2 genomic data (n = 11,065 sequences) with epidemiological data of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases collected in Brazil between October 2022 and July 2023 to reconstruct the space-time dynamics and epidemiologic impact of XBB dissemination in the country. Our analyses revealed that the introduction and local emergence of lineages carrying convergent mutations within the Spike protein, especially F486P, F456L, and L455F, propelled the spread of XBB* lineages in Brazil. The average relative instantaneous reproduction numbers of XBB*+F486P, XBB*+F486P+F456L, and XBB*+F486P+ F456L+L455F lineages in Brazil were estimated to be 1.24, 1.33, and 1.48 higher than that of other co-circulating lineages (mainly BQ.1*/BE*), respectively. Despite such a growth advantage, the dissemination of these XBB* lineages had a reduced impact on Brazil’s epidemiological scenario concerning previous Omicron subvariants. The peak number of SARI cases from SARS-CoV-2 during the XBB wave was approximately 90%, 80%, and 70% lower than that observed during the previous BA.1*, BA.5*, and BQ.1* waves, respectively. These findings revealed the emergence of multiple XBB lineages with progressively increasing growth advantage, yet with relatively limited epidemiological impact in Brazil throughout 2023. The XBB*+F486P+F456L+L455F lineages stand out for their heightened transmissibility, warranting close monitoring in the months ahead.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFAPEAM F.G.N.

%X SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, while the decline in clinical sequencing efforts hampers public health sectors to prepare for the menace of ongoing variant emergence and future COVID-19 surges.1 Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been proposed to provide complementary insights on the variants being transmitted in communities.2 However, limited research has been dedicated to the use sequencing methods for tracking disease prevalence and variant dynamics in wastewater, particularly on a large scale. Here, we employed a tiling amplicon sequencing to track the dynamics of variant of concern (VOC) in wastewater collected from Queensland, Australia from 2020 to 2022. RNA concentrations in wastewater measured by ATOPlex showed a stronger correlation and greater consistency with the number of daily new cases than a PCR-based method. The VOC dynamics observed in wastewater were largely in line with clinical reports. These findings support that WBE and sensitive sequencing methods can serve as a long-term approach for disease surveillance, thus aiding in disease outbreak prevention, control, and management.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJG would like to acknowledge the Australian Research Council for funding support through Discovery Project (DP220101526).

%X The COVID-19 post-pandemic period is characterised by infection waves of uncertain size (due to low rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing and notification), as well as limited uptake or global access to updated variant vaccines. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution has given rise to recombinant Omicron lineages that dominate globally (XBB.1), as well as the emergence of hypermutated variants (BA.2.86). In this context, durable and cross-reactive T-cell immune memory is critical for continued protection against severe COVID-19. We examined T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 approximately 1.5 years since Omicron first emerged. We describe sustained CD4+ and CD8+ spike-specific T-cell memory responses in healthcare workers in South Africa (n=39), most of whom had received 2 doses of Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen) vaccine and experienced at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spike-specific T cells were highly cross-reactive with all Omicron variants tested, including BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike (nucleocapsid and membrane)-specific T cells were detectable in most participants, augmenting the total T-cell resources available for protection. The bulk of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses had an early-differentiated phenotype, explaining their persistent nature. Thus, hybrid immunity leads to the accumulation of spike and non-spike T cells evident 3.5 years after the start of the pandemic, with preserved recognition of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Long-term T-cell immune memory is likely to provide continued protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19.In Brief Nesamari et al. investigate T-cell responses in the context of hybrid immunity 3.5 years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They show that T-cell memory is highly durable and cross-reactive with recombinant variants XBB.1 and hypermutated BA.2.86. Abundant non-spike responses augment the overall T-cell response.Competing Interest StatementAlex Sette is a consultant for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Calyptus Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Darwin Health, EmerVax, EUROIMMUN, F.

%T Association between vaccination rates and COVID-19 health outcomes in the United States: a population-level statistical analysis

%X Population-level vaccine efficacy is a critical component of understanding COVID-19 risk, informing public health policy, and mitigating disease impacts. Unlike individual-level clinical trials, population-level analysis characterizes how well vaccines worked in the face of real-world challenges like emerging variants, differing mobility patterns, and policy changes. In this study, we analyze the association between time-dependent vaccination rates and COVID-19 health outcomes for 48 U.S. states. We primarily focus on case-hospitalization risk (CHR) as the outcome of interest, using it as a population-level proxy for disease burden on healthcare systems. Performing the analysis using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) allowed us to incorporate real-world nonlinearities and control for critical dynamic (time-changing) and static (temporally constant) factors. Dynamic factors include testing rates, activity-related engagement levels in the population, underlying population immunity, and policy. Static factors incorporate comorbidities, social vulnerability, race, and state healthcare expenditures. We used SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data to model the different COVID-19 variant-driven waves separately, and evaluate if there is a changing role of the potential drivers of health outcomes across waves. Our study revealed a strong and statistically significant negative association between vaccine uptake and COVID-19 CHR across each variant wave, with boosters providing additional protection during the Omicron wave. Higher underlying population immunity is shown to be associated with reduced COVID-19 CHR. Additionally, more stringent government policies are generally associated with decreased CHR. However, the impact of activity-related engagement levels on COVID-19 health outcomes varied across different waves. Regarding static variables, the social vulnerability index consistently exhibits positive associations with CHR, while Medicaid spending per person consistently shows a negative association. However, the impacts of other static factors vary in magnitude and significance across different waves. This study concludes that despite the emergence of new variants, vaccines remain highly correlated with reduced COVID-19 harm. Therefore, given the ongoing threat posed by COVID-19, vaccines remain a critical line of defense for protecting the public and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded the NSF RAPID Award ID 2108526, NSF Award ID 2229996, and CDC Contract #75D30120C09570.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and COVID-19 disease severity is influenced by immunity acquired by natural exposure and/or vaccination, whereby most vaccines are formulated on the Ancestral strain. However, population-level immunity is complicated by the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs), such as Omicron that is the dominant variant currently in circulation. Antibody Fc-dependent effector functions are being increasingly recognised as important mediators in immunity, especially against VOCs. However, induction of these functions in populations with diverse infection and/or vaccination histories, remains poorly defined. Here, we evaluated Fc-dependent functional antibodies following vaccination with two widely used vaccines: AstraZeneca (AZ; ChAdOx1-S) and Sinovac (SV). We quantified FcγR-binding and C1q-fixing antibodies against Ancestral and variant spike (S) proteins in Brazilian adults vaccinated with AZ or SV (n=222), some of which were previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2. AZ induced greater FcγR-binding responses to Ancestral S than the SV vaccine. Previously exposed individuals had significantly greater vaccine-induced responses compared to their naïve counterparts, with notably high C1q-fixation levels, irrespective of vaccine type. FcγR-binding was highest among AZ vaccinated individuals with a prior exposure, and these responses were well retained against the Omicron S protein. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of vaccine-induced immunity and its effectiveness against evolving variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (Investigator Grant to JGB) and Burnet Institute.

%X Due to a combination of asymptomatic or undiagnosed infections, the proportion of the United States population infected with SARS-CoV-2 was unclear from the beginning of the pandemic. We previously established a platform to screen for SARS-CoV-2 positivity across a representative proportion of the US population, from which we reported that almost 17 million Americans were estimated to have had undocumented infections in the Spring of 2020. Since then, vaccine rollout and prevalence of different SARS-CoV-2 variants have further altered seropositivity trends within the United States population. To explore the longitudinal impacts of the pandemic and vaccine responses on seropositivity, we re-enrolled participants from our baseline study in a 6- and 12-month follow-up study to develop a longitudinal antibody profile capable of representing seropositivity within the United States during a critical period just prior to and during the initiation of vaccine rollout. Initial measurements showed that, since July 2020, seropositivity elevated within this population from 4.8% at baseline to 36.2% and 89.3% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. We also evaluated nucleocapsid seropositivity and compared to spike seropositivity to identify trends in infection versus vaccination relative to baseline. These data serve as a window into a critical timeframe within the COVID-19 pandemic response and serve as a resource that could be used in subsequent respiratory illness outbreaks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported, in part, by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, including the National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and the National Cancer Institute.

%X Vaccine development targeting SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 was of critical importance in reducing COVID-19 severity and mortality. In the U.K. during the initial roll-out most individuals either received two doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) or the adenovirus-based vaccine from Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-nCoV-19). There are conflicting data as to the impact of age, sex and body habitus on cellular and humoral responses to vaccination, and most studies in this area have focused on determinants of mRNA vaccine immunogenicity. Here we studied a cohort of participants in a population-based longitudinal study (COVIDENCE UK) to determine the influence of age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and pre- vaccination anti-Spike (anti-S) antibody status on vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses to two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx-n-CoV-19 vaccination.Younger age and pre-vaccination anti-S seropositivity were both associated with stronger antibody responses to vaccination. BNT162b2 generated higher neutralising and anti-S antibody titres to vaccination than ChAdOx1-nCoV-19, but cellular responses to the two vaccines were no different. Irrespective of vaccine type, increasing age was also associated with decreased frequency of cytokine double-positive CD4+ T cells. Increasing BMI was associated with reduced frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific TNF+ CD8% T cells for both vaccines.Together, our findings demonstrate that increasing age and BMI associate with attenuated cellular and humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Whilst both vaccines induced T cell responses, BNT162b2 induced significantly elevated humoral immune response as compared to ChAdOx-n-CoV-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by Barts Charity (grants MGU0466 to A.

%X Wastewater surveillance is a powerful tool for monitoring the prevalence of infectious disease. Systems for wastewater monitoring were put in place throughout the world during the COVID-19 pandemic. These systems use viral RNA copies as the basis of estimates of COVID-19 cases in the sewershed area, thereby providing data critical for public health responses. However, the potential to measure other biomarkers in wastewater during outbreaks has not been fully explored. Here we report a novel approach for detecting specific human antibodies from wastewater. We measured the abundance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG and IgA from fresh samples of community wastewater and from archived frozen samples dating from 2020-22. The assay described can be performed with readily available reagents, at a moderate per-sample cost. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of noninvasive serological surveillance via wastewater, enabling a new approach to immunity-based monitoring of populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding was provided by the UNC-Charlotte Division of Research.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Testing was paramount in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our university established KCL TEST: a SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing programme that enabled sensitive and accessible PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. We performed 158,277 PCRs for our staff, students, and their household contacts, free of charge. Our average turnaround time was 16h and 37 mins from user registration to result delivery. KCL TEST combined open-source automation and in house non-commercial reagents, which allows for rapid deployment. Here we provide our blueprint, recently recommended for ISO15189 accreditation, and results to enable the rapid launch of diagnostic laboratories where and when needed, particularly in low-resource settings. Our data span over 18 months and parallels that of the UK Office for National Statistics, with a lower positive rate and virtually no delta wave. Our observations strongly support regular asymptomatic community testing to decrease outbreaks and provide safe working spaces. Universities can therefore provide agile, resilient, and accurate testing that reflects the infection rate and trend of the general population. We call for the integration of academic institutions in pandemic preparedness, with capabilities to rapidly deploy highly skilled staff, as well as develop, test and accommodate efficient low-cost pipelines.Competing Interest StatementDr Rahul Batra is the owner of IC Intelligence LTD who helped with the processing of samples for UKAS accreditation.Funding StatementKCL TEST was funded by Kings College London and supported by the Huo Family Foundation grant (MHM and RTMN).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:KCL TEST was initially set up as a research project under Kings College London ethics number HR-20/21-21150 and then continued as a service delivery.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X COVID-19 testing policies varied in time from testing only the symptomatic, testing the symptomatic and persons at higher risk of severe disease, on-demand testing for people who wanted one, and two periods of government-imposed mass testing in Slovakia. Using Poisson regression, this study examines the associations of COVID-19 cases during the times that the noted policies were in effect in 34 countries rated highest on democracy scores. Statistically corrected for other risk factors, increases in negative tests were associated with subsequent surges in cases when on-demand testing was promoted, particularly when coupled with poor contact tracing. Mass testing in Slovakia was associated with reduced spread of the virus for short periods but was deemed unsustainable. The data support the hypothesis that on-demand testing resulted in the unanticipated consequence of increased travel and increased exposure of travelers to the virus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background XAV-19 is a glyco-humanized swine polyclonal antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2. The safety and clinical efficacy of XAV-19 was investigated in patients with a WHO score of 2 to 4 in the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. The activity of XAV-19 against Omicron and its subvariants was assessed in vitro.Methods A phase II/III, multicentric randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of XAV-19 in inpatients with COVID-19 requiring or not oxygen therapy and outpatients not requiring oxygen (EUROXAV trial, NCT04928430). Most patients were not vaccinated. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an aggravation of COVID-19 within 8 days after treatment. Binding and neutralization of Omicron or its subvariants by XAV-19 was investigated by ELISA or with a whole virus neutralization assay.Results Patients received either 150mg of XAV-19 (N=139) or placebo (N=140). Low enrolment forced the premature trial termination. XAV-19 was well tolerated. No difference in the primary endpoint, nor in the proportion with an improvement at day 8 (secondary endpoint) was observed between the 2 groups. For patients not requiring oxygen therapy, XAV-19 reduced the time to improvement significantly (7 days vs 14 days p=0.0159). Neutralizing activity against Omicron and BA.2, BA2.12.1, BA.4/5 and BQ1.1 subvariants was shown in vitro.Conclusions XAV-19 did not reduce the aggravation in COVID-19 patients. While it did not bring any benefit to patients requiring oxygen, it reduced the time to improvement for patients not requiring oxygen (WHO score 2 or 3). These preliminary clinical data might indicate a therapeutic potential for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 requiring supplementation with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.Competing Interest StatementPJR, GE, FS, BV and OD are employees of XenotheraClinical TrialNCT04928430Funding StatementThis project has received funding from Bpifrance and from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 962036.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:-Research Ethics Committee from PUERTA DE HIERRO MAJADAHONDA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL gave approval for this work. -Romania National Bioethics Committee of Medicine and Medical Devices gave approval for this work. -Greece National Ethics Committee gave approval for this work. -Istanbul Medipol University Clinical Research Ethics Committee gave approval for this work. -Bulgaria Ethics Committee for Clinical Trials gave approval for this work.

%X Wastewater-based epidemiology provides an approach for assessing the prevalence of pathogens such as COVID-19 in a sewer service area. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured serially in 44 wastewater treatment plants of varying service capacities comprising approximately 67% of the population of Minnesota, from September 2020 through December 2022. We employed linear regression models to establish a predictive relationship between the weekly SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater and clinical case counts. Metrics were assessed under specified transformation and normalization methods which we confirmed by cross-validation averaged across the enrolled treatment plants. We report that the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may be treatment plant-specific. Toward establishing guidelines for pathogen surveillance, we further studied storage and time-to-analysis for RNA wastewater data and observed large effects of storage temperature, indicating that collection methods may have an important effect on the utility and validity of wastewater data for infectious disease monitoring. Our findings are additive for any large-scale wastewater surveillance program.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded, in part, by a grant from 3M and the Minnesota Department of Health.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Genome sequencing can offer critical insight into pathogen spread in viral outbreaks, but existing transmission inference methods use simplistic evolutionary models and only incorporate a portion of available genetic data. Here, we develop a robust evolutionary model for transmission reconstruction that tracks the genetic composition of within-host viral populations over time and the lineages transmitted between hosts. We confirm that our model reliably describes within-host variant frequencies in a dataset of 134,682 SARS-CoV-2 deep-sequenced genomes from Massachusetts, USA. We then demonstrate that our reconstruction approach infers transmissions more accurately than two leading methods on synthetic data, as well as in a controlled outbreak of bovine respiratory syncytial virus and an epidemiologically-investigated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in South Africa. Finally, we apply our transmission reconstruction tool to 5,692 outbreaks among the 134,682 Massachusetts genomes. Our methods and results demonstrate the utility of within-host variation for transmission inference of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, and provide an adaptable mathematical framework for tracking within-host evolution.Competing Interest StatementP.C.S. is a co-founder and shareholder of Sherlock Biosciences and Delve Bio and is a non-executive board member and shareholder of Danaher Corporation.

%X At the beginning of 2021 the monitoring of the circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 was established in Germany in accordance with the Corona Surveillance Act (discontinued after July 2023) to allow a better containment of the pandemic, because certain amino acid exchanges (especially) in the spike protein lead to higher transmission as well as a reduced vaccination efficacy.Therefore, our group performed whole genome sequencing applying the ARTIC protocol (currently V4) on Illumina’s NextSeq 500 platform (and starting in May 2023 on the MiSeq DX platform) for SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen from patients of the Heidelberg University Hospital (and associated hospitals) as well as the Public health office in Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region.Our group sequenced a total of 26,795 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples between January 2021 and July 2023 - valid sequences, according to the requirements for sequence upload to the German electronic sequencing data hub (DESH) operated by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), could be determined for 24,852 samples, while the lineage/clade could be identified for 25,912 samples.While the year 2021 was very dynamic and changing regarding the circulating variants in the Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region with the initial non-variant of concerns, followed by A.27.RN and the rise of B.1.1.7 in winter/spring and its displacement by B.1.617.2 in spring/summer, which remained almost exclusive until the beginning of December and the first B.1.1.529 incidences, which rose to a proportion of 40 percent by the end of 2021 (and superseded B.1.617.2 by January 2022 with a proportion of over 90 percent). The years 2022 and 2023 were then dominated by B.1.1.529 and its numerous sublineages, especially BA.5 and BA.2, and more recently by the rise of recombinant variants, such as XBB.1.5. By the end of July 2023 (and since calendar week 20) the proportion of the recombinant variants amounted to 100 percent of all circulating variants in the Rhine-Neckar/Heidelberg region.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementStudy was conducted in accordance Corona-Surveillance Germany and Baden-Wuerttemberg (tests were conducted as part of the virology diagnostics department)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty at the University of Heidelberg for the analysis of proband samples by whole genome sequencing of the viral RNA (S316/2021) as well as the virus propagation and neutralization assays and use of sera from vaccinated donors (S203/2021).

%X COVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations.We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios.We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to ‘buy’ in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementEF was supported by the Medical Research Council (MR/N013638/1); AJK was supported by Wellcome Trust (206250/Z/17/Z); RL was supported by a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgin Fellowship; EJK was supported by the US CDC (U01GH002238), CLL was supported by an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Investigator Grant (APP1158469).

%T No evidence that analgesic use after COVID-19 vaccination negatively impacts antibody responses

%X Uptake of mRNA vaccines, especially booster immunizations, against COVID-19 has been lower than hoped, perhaps in part due to their reactogenicity. Analgesics might alleviate symptoms associated with vaccination, but studies to measure their impact on immune responses have been limited to relatively small cohorts. We semi-quantitatively measured antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination in 2354 human participants surveyed about analgesic use. Participants who used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen after vaccination showed elevated antibody levels against the receptor binding domain of Spike protein relative to those who did not use analgesics. This pattern was observed for both mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 and across age groups. Participants who used analgesics more frequently reported fatigue, muscle aches, and headaches than those who did not use painkillers. Amongst participants who reported these symptoms, we observed no statistically significant differences in antibody levels irrespective of analgesic use. These data suggest that antibody levels are elevated as a function of symptoms and inflammatory processes rather than painkiller use per se. Taken together, we find no evidence that analgesic use reduces antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination. Recommendation of their use to alleviate symptoms might improve uptake of booster immunizations.Competing Interest StatementSana Biotechnology has licensed intellectual property of D.B. and Washington University in St. Louis.

%X Virus-specific antibodies are important determinants of protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While regarded as the gold standard for detecting functional antibodies, conventional virus neutralisation tests (VNT) or pseudotyped virus neutralisation tests (pVNT) require biosafety level 2 or 3 facilities. Alternatively, the virus-free surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT) quantifies inhibitory antibodies that prevent the spike protein from binding to its receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2).We evaluated secreted nanoluciferase (NLuc)-tagged spike (S) protein fragments as diagnostic antigens in the sVNT in the framework of a vaccination study. First, spike fragments of different lengths were tested for their suitability as diagnostic antigens in a capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using unprocessed culture supernatants of transfected cells, identifying the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S as the optimal construct. The sensitivity of the in-house sVNT relying on the NLuc-labelled RBD equalled or surpassed a commercial sVNT (cPass, GenScript Diagnostics) and an in-house pVNT four weeks after the first vaccination (98% vs. 94% and 72%, respectively), reaching 100% in all assays four weeks after the second and third vaccinations. Additionally, serum reactivity with spike constructs of Omicron BA.1 was tested. Compared with a capture EIA, the in-house sVNT and pVNT displayed superior discrimination between wild-type- and variant-specific reactivity of sera. Differences in reactivity were most pronounced after the first and second vaccinations, whereas the third vaccination resulted in robust, cross-reactive detection of Omicron constructs.In conclusion, assays utilising NLuc-labelled protein fragments permit the quantification and functional assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and the detection of variant-specific differences in reactivity. Potential applications include monitoring therapy and vaccine efficacy and follow-up of prolonged disease courses in high-risk groups. Designed as straightforward, highly flexible modular systems, these tests can be readily adapted to further emerging viral variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was partially funded by the Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany (grant CPS-1-1G).

%X Researchers and policymakers have proposed systems to detect novel pathogens earlier than existing surveillance systems by monitoring samples from hospital patients, wastewater, and air travel, in order to mitigate future pandemics. How much benefit would such systems offer? We developed, empirically validated, and mathematically characterized a quantitative model that simulates disease spread and detection time for any given disease and detection system. We find that hospital monitoring could have detected COVID-19 in Wuhan 0.4 weeks earlier than it was actually discovered, at 2,300 cases (standard error: 76 cases) compared to 3,400 (standard error: 161 cases). Wastewater monitoring would not have accelerated COVID-19 detection in Wuhan, but provides benefit in smaller catchments and for asymptomatic or long-incubation diseases like polio or HIV/AIDS. Monitoring of air travel provides little benefit in most scenarios we evaluated. In sum, early detection systems can substantially mitigate some future pandemics, but would not have changed the course of COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementWPH is a member of the scientific advisory board and has stock options in BioBot Analytics.

%X SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB subvariants efficiently evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination, requiring vaccine adaptation. Here, we analyzed immunogenicity of an adapted vaccine, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5, which is currently used for booster vaccination. Booster vaccination significantly increased anti-Spike IgG, accompanied by expansion of cross-reactive memory B cells recognizing Wuhan and Omicron XBB.1.5 spike variants. Geometric mean neutralizing titers against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3, as well as cross-reactive responses against EG.5.1 and BA.2.86 increased significantly relative to pre-booster titers. Finally, the number of Wuhan and XBB.1.5 spike reactive IFN-γ-producing T cells significantly increased after booster vaccination. In summary, BNT162b2 Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccination resulted in potent neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron XBB variants, including the recent Omicron variants EG.5.1 (Eris) and BA.2.86 (Pirola), as well as XBB.1.5 reactive T cell responses, suggesting that booster vaccination will augment protection against these emerging variants.Competing Interest StatementM.H., A.K., and S.P. conducted contract research (testing of vaccinee sera for neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2) for Valneva unrelated to this work.

%X DVGs (Defective Viral Genomes) and SIP (Semi-Infectious Particle) are commonly present in RNA virus infections. In this study, we analyzed high-throughput sequencing data and found that DVGs or SIPs are also widely present in SARS-CoV-2. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with various DNA viruses revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more susceptible to damage and has greater sequencing sample heterogeneity. Variability analysis at the whole-genome sequencing depth showed a higher coefficient of variation for SARS-CoV-2, and DVG analysis indicated a high proportion of splicing sites, suggesting significant genome heterogeneity and implying that most virus particles assembled are enveloped with incomplete RNA sequences. We further analyzed the characteristics of different strains in terms of sequencing depth and DVG content differences and found that as the virus evolves, the proportion of intact genomes in virus particles increases, which can be significantly reflected in third-generation sequencing data, while the proportion of DVG gradually decreases. Specifically, the proportion of intact genome of Omicron was greater than that of Delta and Alpha strains. This can well explain why Omicron strain is more infectious than Delta and Alpha strains. We also speculate that this improvement in completeness is due to the enhancement of virus assembly ability, as the Omicron strain can quickly realize the binding of RNA and capsid protein, thereby shortening the exposure time of exposed virus RNA in the host environment and greatly reducing its degradation level. Finally, by using mathematical modeling, we simulated how DVG effects under different environmental factors affect the infection characteristics and evolution of the population. We can explain well why the severity of symptoms is closely related to the amount of virus invasion and why the same strain causes huge differences in population infection characteristics under different environmental conditions. Our study provides a new approach for future virus research and vaccine development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded by DeZhou University (No. 30101418) and the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32070662, 61832019, 32030063).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X SARS-CoV-2 is a contagious respiratory virus that has been discovered in sewage, human waste, and wastewater treatment facilities. Wastewater surveillance has been considered one of the lowest-cost means of testing for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in communities. This paper highlights the dynamics of the virus’s infection, persistence, and occurrence in wastewater treatment plants. Our aim is to develop and implement a mathematical model to infer the epidemic dynamics from the possible density of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater. We present a log-normal model and fractional order of susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery (SEIR) epidemic model for predicting the spread of the COVID-19 disease from the wastewater data. We study the dynamic properties of the fractional order SEIR model with respect to the fractional ordered values. The model is used to comprehend how the coronavirus spreads through wastewater treatment plants in Saudi Arabia. Our modeling approach can help with wastewater surveillance for early prediction and cost-effective monitoring of the epidemic outbreak in a situation of low testing capacity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research and Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia, for funding this research work through project number ISP22-6.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data are available on the website of Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. https://covid19.moh.gov.sa/I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Our understanding of the quality of cellular and humoral immunity conferred by COVID-19 vaccination alone versus vaccination plus SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough (BT) infection remains incomplete. While the current (2023) SARS-CoV-2 immune landscape of Canadians is complex, in late 2021 most Canadians had either just received a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine, or had received their two dose primary series and then experienced an Omicron BT. Herein we took advantage of this coincident timing to contrast cellular and humoral immunity conferred by three doses of vaccine versus two doses plus BT. Our results show that mild BT infection induces cell-mediated immune responses to variants comparable to an intramuscular vaccine booster dose. In contrast, BT subjects had higher salivary IgG and IgA levels against the Omicron Spike and enhanced reactivity to the ancestral Spike for the IgA isotype, which also reacted with SARS-CoV-1. Serum neutralizing antibody levels against the ancestral strain and the variants were also higher after BT infection. Our results support the need for mucosal vaccines to emulate the enhanced mucosal and humoral immunity induced by Omicron without exposing individuals to the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY Omicron breakthrough elicits cross-reactive systemic and mucosal immune responses in fully vaccinated adults.Competing Interest StatementACG has received research funds from a research contract with Providence Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. for other projects.Funding StatementThis study was supported by funding from a CoVaRR-Net Rapid Response Research Grant (MB, CP, CQ, JR, ACG, HD, JG) under CIHR Rapid Response Network to SARS-CoV-2 Variants (Funding Reference Number : FRN 175622) as well as the following grants : - Canadian Institutes of Health Research GA1-177703 (ACG), GA2-177710 (JG) and VR2172712 (CQ, HD) - Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Canadian Institutes of Health Research 468231 (HD) - Ontario Together COVID-19 Rapid Response 20013418 (JG) - Public Health Agency of Canada 2122-HQ-000225 (CQ, HD) and 2223-HQ-000261 (JG).

%X Background Contact tracing has been one of the central non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented worldwide to try to control the spread of Sars-CoV-2, but its effectiveness strongly depends on its ability to detect contacts.Methods We analysed 166’892 concomitant infections occurring at the same address from June 2020 until February 2022 using an extensive operational database of SARS-CoV-2 tests in Geneva and used permutations statistics to compare the total number of secondary infections occurring at the address with those reported through contact tracing.Results Manual contact tracing captured on average 41% of the secondary infections, with variation in time from 23% during epidemic peaks to 60% during low epidemic activity. People living in wealthy neighbourhoods were less likely to report contacts (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.6). People living in buildings, compared to people living in single house, were also less likely to report contacts than those living in houses, with an aOR of 1.1 to 3.1 depending on the variant, the size of the building and the presence of shops. This under-reporting of contacts in buildings decreased during periods of mandatory face masking and restriction of private gathering.Conclusions Contact tracing alone does not detect enough secondary infections to efficiently reduce the propagation of Sars-CoV-2. Public messages and outreach campaigns targeting specific populations, such as those in affluent areas, could enhance coverage. Additionally, measures like wearing face masks, improving ventilation, and implementing gathering restrictions should also be considered to reduce the number of infections occurring during interactions that may not be perceived as high risk.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by the research project SELFISH, financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation, grant number 51NF40-160590 (LIVES Center international research project call)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Research received the agreement of the Cantonal Ethic Committee of Geneva (CCER protocol 2020-01273)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background We assessed the association between antibody concentration ≤5 days of symptom onset and COVID-19 illness among patients enrolled in a test-negative studyMethods From October 2021─June 2022, study sites in seven states enrolled and tested respiratory specimens from patients of all ages presenting with acute respiratory illness for SARS-CoV-2 infection using rRT-PCR. In blood specimens, we measured concentration of anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the ancestral strain spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens in standardized binding antibody units (BAU/mL). Percent reduction in odds of symptomatic COVID-19 by anti-RBD antibody was estimated using logistic regression modeled as (1–adjusted odds ratio of COVID-19)x100, adjusting for COVID-19 vaccination status, age, site, and high-risk exposure.Results A total of 662 (33%) of 2,018 symptomatic patients tested positive for acute SARS- CoV-2 infection. During the Omicron-predominant period, geometric mean anti-RBD binding antibody concentrations measured 823 BAU/mL (95%CI:690─981) among COVID-19 case- patients versus 1,189 BAU/mL (95%CI:1,050─1,347) among SARS-CoV-2 test-negative patients. In the adjusted logistic regression, increasing levels of anti-RBD antibodies were associated with reduced odds of COVID-19 for both Delta and Omicron infections.Conclusion Higher anti-RBD antibodies in patients were associated with protection against symptomatic COVID-19 during emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants.Competing Interest StatementDr. Zimmerman reports grants from CDC, during the conduct of the study, and grants from Sanofi Pasteur, outside the submitted work.

%X Background The origin of novel SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences found in wastewater, without corresponding detection in clinical specimens, remains unclear. We sought to determine the origin of one such “cryptic” wastewater lineage by tracking and characterizing its persistence and genomic evolution over time.Methods We first detected a cryptic lineage in Wisconsin municipal wastewater in January 2022. By systematically sampling wastewater from targeted sub-sewershed lines and maintenance holes using compositing autosamplers, we traced this lineage (labeled WI-CL-001) to its source at a single commercial building. There we detected WI-CL-001 at concentrations as high as 2.7 × 109 genome copies per liter (gc/L) via RT-dPCR. In addition to using metagenomic 12s rRNA sequencing to determine the virus’s host species, we also sequenced SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domains (RBDs), and where possible, whole viral genomes to identify and characterize the evolution of this lineage over the 13 consecutive months that it was detectable.Findings The vast majority of 12s rRNAs sequenced from wastewater leaving the identified source building were human. Additionally, we generated over 100 viral RBD and whole genome sequences from wastewater samples containing the cryptic lineage collected between January 2022 and January 2023. These sequences contained a combination of fixed nucleotide substitutions characteristic of Pango lineage B.1.234, which circulated in humans in Wisconsin at low levels from October 2020 to February 2021. Despite this, mutations in the spike gene, and elsewhere, resembled those subsequently found in Omicron variants.Interpretation We propose that prolonged detection of WI-CL-001 in wastewater represents persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 from a single human initially infected by an ancestral B.1.234 virus. The accumulation of convergent “Omicron-like” mutations in WI-CL-001’s ancestral B.1.234 genome likely reflects persistent infection and extensive within-host evolution.Funding The Rockefeller Foundation, Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis and Transmission.Evidence before this study To identify other studies that characterized unusual wastewater-specific SARS-CoV-2 lineages, we conducted a PubMed search using the keywords “cryptic SARS-CoV-2 lineages” or “novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages” in addition to “wastewater” on May 9, 2023. From the 18 papers retrieved, only two reported wastewater-specific cryptic lineages. These lineages were identified by members of our author team in wastewater from California, Missouri, and New York City. None of these could be definitively traced to a specific source.A third study in Nevada identified a unique recombinant variant (designated Pango lineage XL) in wastewater, which was also discovered in two clinical specimens from the same community. However, it was unclear whether the clinical specimens collected were from the same individual(s) responsible for the virus detected in the wastewater. To our knowledge, no prior study has successfully traced novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages detected in wastewater back to a specific location. How and where cryptic lineages are introduced into wastewater is not known.The added value of this study This study documents the presence and likely source of a novel and highly divergent cryptic SARS-CoV-2 lineage detected in Wisconsin wastewater for 13 months. In contrast to previously reported cryptic lineages, we successfully traced the lineage (WI-CL-001) to a single commercial building with approximately 30 employees. The exceptionally high viral RNA concentrations at the source building facilitated the tracing effort and allowed for the sequencing of WI-CL-001’s whole genome, expanding our view of the lineage’s mutational landscape beyond the spike gene.Implications of all the available evidence WI-CL-001’s persistence in wastewater, its heavily mutated Omicron-like genotype, and its identified point source at a human-occupied commercial building all support the hypothesis that cryptic wastewater lineages can arise from persistently infected humans. Because cryptic wastewater lineages have some amino acid changes that subsequently emerge in circulating viruses, increased global monitoring of such lineages could help forecast variants that may arise in the future.Competing Interest StatementYK has received unrelated funding support from Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceutical, Toyama Chemical, Tauns Laboratories, Shionogi, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, KM Biologics, Kyoritsu Seiyaku, Shinya Corporation and Fuji RebioFunding StatementThis study was made possible by the generous support of the Rockefeller Foundation's Regional Accelerators for Genomics Surveillance (DHO/TCF), Wisconsin Department of Health Services Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity funds (www.dhs.wisconsin.gov, 144 AAJ8216) to DHO, CDC contract 75D30121C11060 (DHO/TCF), Wisconsin Department of Health Services ELC Wastewater Surveillance funds (www.dhs.wisconsin.gov, 130:AAI8627) to the UW-Madison Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH), and NIDA contract 1U01DA053893-01 (MJ).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All human subjects work was conducted by the CDC and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and was consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy (see ethics statement).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Deep sequencing of wastewater to detect SARS-Cov-2 has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor viral variants as they appear and circulate in communities. SARS-CoV-2 lineages of an unknown source that have not been detected in clinical samples, referred to as cryptic lineages, are sometimes repeatedly detected in specific locations. We have continued to detect one such lineage previously seen in a Missouri site. This cryptic lineage has continued to evolve, indicating continued selective pressure similar to that observed in Omicron lineages.Author Summary Monitoring sewage for SARS-CoV-2 has been an important part of understanding the dynamics of the virus’s spread and persistence within and across communities during the pandemic. We and others have also observed variants appearing in wastewater that do not appear in clinical sampling. Many of these variants not only possess genomic changes identical to or at the same position as those that have been observed in variants of concern, particularly currently circulating Omicron variants, but often acquire the changes before they have been observed in clinical samples. We report here the continued observation of a variant in Missouri wastewater, but not in clinical sampling, that has continued to evolve, gaining genomic changes that often are the same and predate changes seen in clinical samples. These observation add to our understanding of the selective pressures driving the evolution of SAR-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the NIH grant U01DA053893-01Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X We report the genomic analysis of a highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 sample obtained in October 2022 from an HIV+ patient with presumably long-term COVID-19 infection. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the sample is characterized by a gain of 89 mutations since divergence from its nearest sequenced neighbor, which had been collected in September 2020 and belongs to the B.1.1 lineage, largely extinct in 2022. 33 of these mutations were coding and occurred in the Spike protein. Of these, 17 are lineage-defining in some of the variants of concern (VOCs) or are in sites where another mutation is lineage-defining in a variant of concern, and/or shown to be involved in antibody evasion, and/or detected in other cases of persistent COVID-19; these include some “usual suspects,” such as Spike:L452R, E484Q, K417T, Y453F, and N460K. Molecular clock analysis indicates that mutations in this lineage accumulated at an increased rate compared to the ancestral B.1.1 strain. This increase is driven by the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations, for an average dN/dS value of 2.2, indicating strong positive selection during within-patient evolution. Additionally, there is reason to believe that the virus had persisted for at least some time in the gastrointestinal tract, as evidenced by the presence of mutations that are rare in the general population samples but common in samples from wastewater. Our analysis adds to the growing body of research on evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in chronically infected patients and its relationship to the emergence of variants of concern.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work has been supported by the RSF grant no 21-74-20160 to GVK.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The research was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (protocol No. 203, 18 May 2023)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Vaccine-induced immunity may impact subsequent de novo responses to drifted epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 variants, but this has been difficult to quantify due to the challenges in recruiting unvaccinated control groups whose first exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is a primary infection. Through local, statewide, and national SARS-CoV-2 testing programs, we were able to recruit cohorts of individuals who had recovered from either primary or post-vaccination infections by either the Delta or Omicron BA.1 variants. Regardless of variant, we observed greater Spike-specific and neutralizing antibody responses in post-vaccination infections than in those who were infected without prior vaccination. Through analysis of variant-specific memory B cells as markers of de novo responses, we observed that Delta and Omicron BA.1 infections led to a marked shift in immunodominance in which some drifted epitopes elicited minimal responses, even in primary infections. Prior immunity through vaccination had a small negative impact on these de novo responses, but this did not correlate with cross-reactive memory B cells, arguing against competitive inhibition of naïve B cells. We conclude that dampened de novo B cell responses against drifted epitopes are mostly a function of altered immunodominance hierarchies that are apparent even in primary infections, with a more modest contribution from pre-existing immunity, perhaps due to accelerated antigen clearance.Competing Interest StatementSana Biotechnology has licensed intellectual property of D.B. and Washington University in St. Louis.

%X Estimation of the impact of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on COVID-19 incidence is complicated by several factors, including the successive emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and changing population immunity resulting from vaccination and previous infection. We developed an age-structured multi-strain COVID-19 transmission model and inference framework that could estimate the impact of vaccination and NPIs while accounting for these factors. We applied this framework to French Polynesia, which experienced multiple large COVID-19 waves from multiple variants over the course of the pandemic, interspersed with periods of elimination. We estimated that the vaccination programme averted 49.6% (95% credible interval (CI) 48.7–50.5%) of the 5830 hospitalisations and 64.2% (95% CI 63.1–65.3%) of the 1540 hospital deaths that would have occurred in a baseline scenario without any vaccination up to May 2022. Vaccination also averted an estimated 34.8% (95% CI 34.5–35.2%) of 223,000 symptomatic cases in the baseline scenario. We estimated the booster campaign contributed 4.5%, 1.9% and 0.4% to overall reductions in cases, hospitalisations and hospital deaths respectively. Our results suggested that removing, or altering the timings of, the lockdowns during the first two waves had non-linear effects on overall incidence owing to the resulting effect on accumulation of population immunity. Our estimates of vaccination and booster impact differ from those for other countries due to differences in age structure, previous exposure levels and timing of variant introduction relative to vaccination, emphasising the importance of detailed analysis that accounts for these factors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementLACC and AJK are supported by funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR200908) and Wellcome Trust (206250/Z/17/Z).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Secondary data analysis of routinely collected COVID-19 data from French Polynesia was approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Observational Research Ethics Committee (ref 28129).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in protecting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including providing high protection against severe disease during the emergence of variant waves. In this study, we aimed to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of a 2-dose regimen of the LPP-based mRNA vaccine, SW-BIC-213, in Laos.Methods For this phase 1/2 clinical trial, we recruited healthy adults aged 18-60 years (phase 1) or ≥18 years (phase 2) from Mahosot Hospital (Vientiane) and Champhone District Hospital (Savannakhet). Participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous COVID-19 vaccination, known allergies to any vaccine component, or pregnancy were excluded. In the phase 1 trial, 41 eligible participants were sequentially assigned to either the 25 μg dose group (25 μg) or the 45 μg dose group (45 μg) in accordance with their enrollment order, with 21 participants in 45 μg dose group and 20 participants in 25 μg dose group. In the phase 2 trial, 480 participants were randomly allocated (2:2:1 ratio) to either the 25 μg dose group, 45 μg dose group, or placebo group.The primary endpoints for the phase 1 trial were the incidence of local/systemic solicited adverse reactions/events (0-6 days after each vaccination dose), unsolicited adverse events (0-21 days and 0-28 days after the first and second dose of immunization, respectively), and serious adverse events from the first dose of vaccination to 28 days after completing the full course of immunization. In the phase 2 trial, the primary endpoints were the seroconversion rate and geometric mean titer (GMT) of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies 14 days after the second dose in participants. As for neutralizing antibodies, we detected pseudo-virus neutralizing antibody against wild type (WT), Delta, BA.1 and BA.2. We also detected live viral neutralizing antibody against WT strain 14 days after the second dose. Furthermore, the safety endpoints were also measured during the trial.This seamless phase 1/2 trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT05144139.Results Between December 3, 2021, and March 31, 2022, a total of 41 participants were recruited in the phase 1 trial, while the phase 2 trial enrolled 480 participants from January 20 to July 6, 2022. In the phase 1 trial, a total of 32 subjects (80.0%) reported 103 cases of adverse reactions. All adverse reactions were limited to Grade 1-2. In the phase 2 trial, a total of 479 subjects, 372 subjects (77.7%) reported 929 cases of adverse reactions. All adverse reactions in severity of Grade 3 were manifested as fever (3.4%, 2.1% and 2.9% in 45 μg dose, 25 μg dose and placebo group respectively, only observed in adults), except which all other reactions were limited to Grade 1-2. All adverse reactions noted during the study were tolerable, predominantly transient, and resolved spontaneously. No serious adverse events (SAEs) related to vaccination were observed.In Phase 2 study, SW-BIC-213 could elicit a high level of seroconversion rate of pseudo-virus neutralizing antibody against WT (100.0% in 25 μg dose group, 99.3% in 45 μg dose group), Delta (99.2% in 25 μg dose group, 98.0% in 45 μg dose group), Omicron BA.1 (84.1% in 25 μg dose group, 84.7% in 45 μg dose group) and Omicron BA.2 (96.0% in 25 μg dose group, 88.8% in 45 μg dose group) at 14 days after the second dose. The pseudo-virus neutralizing antibody titer against WT, Delta, BA.1 and BA.2 was all significant higher (P&lt;0.0001) in both 45 μg dose group (1175.02, 620.62, 72.39 and 172.80) and 25 μg dose group (885.80, 579.40, 47.24 and 101.96) compared with the placebo group (9.67, 10.66, 13.99 and 29.53) at 14 days after the second dose. As for live viral neutralizing antibodies against WT strain, the seroconversion rate could reach more than 94% at 14 days after second dose. The neutralizing antibody titer against WT strain was significantly higher (P&lt;0.0001) in both 45 μg dose group (315.00) and 25 μg dose group (323.18) compared with the placebo group (8.51) at 14 days after second dose.Conclusion COVID-19 mRNA vaccine SW-BIC-213 manifests a favorable safety profile and is highly immunogenic in eligible subjects aged ≥18 years.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT05144139Funding StatementThis study was funded by StemiRNA TherapeuticsAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The trial received approval from the Ethics Committee and Food &amp; Drug Department of the Ministry of Health, Lao PDR (7745).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In India, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave (2020-21) gradually faded away with the advent of the Omicron variants (2021-present). Dengue incidences were observably less in Southeast Asia during the active years of the pandemic (2020-21). However, Dengue virus type 3 (DV3) cases were increasingly reported in India and many other dengue-endemic countries concurrent with the progression of the Omicron wave since 2022. This observation prompted us to investigate the current state of cross-reactivity between prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants and different DV serotypes.Fifty-five COVID-19 serum samples (collected between January-September, 2022) and three pre-pandemic healthy serum samples were tested for DV or SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G/Immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) using the lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs). The SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab)-positive samples were further tested for their ability to cross-neutralize DV types 1-4 (DV1-4) in Huh7 cell lines.Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DV diminished with the shift from Delta to Omicron prevalence. COVID-19 serum samples that were DV cross-reactive neutralized all DV serotypes, including DV3. However, Omicron wave serum samples were predominantly DV non-cross-reactive (about 70%) in LFIAs and coincided with the prevalence of BA.2 Omicron variant. They also cross-neutralized DV1, 2 and 4 but enhanced DV3 infectivity as evident from increased DV3 titres in virus neutralization test (VNT) compared to control serum samples.In conclusion, DV non-cross-reactive COVID-19 serum samples are becoming increasingly prominent in the present times. These non-cross-reactive serums could neutralize DV1, 2 and 4 but they are contributing to the surge in DV3 cases worldwide by means of ADE.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunded by CSIR-India; grant number: MLP 130 (CSIR Digital Surveillance Vertical for COVID-19 mitigation in India).

%X Omicron BA.2.86 subvariant differs from Omicron BA.2 as well as recently circulating variants by over 30 mutations in the spike protein alone. Here we report on the first isolation of the live BA.2.86 subvariant from a diagnostic swab collected in South Africa which we tested for escape from neutralizing antibodies and viral replication properties in cell culture. BA.2.86 did not have significantly more escape than Omicron XBB.1.5 from neutralizing immunity elicited by infection of Omicron subvariants ranging from BA.1 to XBB, either by infection alone or as breakthrough infection in vaccinated individuals. Neutralization escape was present relative to earlier strains: BA.2.86 showed extensive escape both relative to ancestral virus in sera from pre-Omicron vaccinated individuals and relative to Omicron BA.1 in sera from Omicron BA.1 infected individuals. We did not observe substantial differences in viral properties in cell culture relative to XBB.1.5. Both BA.2.86 and XBB.1.5 produced infection foci of similar size, had similar cytopathic effect (both lower than ancestral SARS-CoV-2), and had similar replication dynamics. We also investigated the relationship of BA.2.86 to BA.2 sequences and found that the closest were BA.2 samples from Southern Africa circulating in early 2022. These observations suggest that BA.2.86 is more closely related to sequences from Southern Africa than other regions and so may have evolved there, and that evolution led to escape from neutralizing antibodies similar in scale to recently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates award INV-018944, Wellcome Trust Award 226137/Z/22/Z, University of Washington Arboviral Research Network (UWARN) Subaward #UWSC14272 and the South African Medical Research Council to AS.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swab for ancestral D614G SARS-CoV-2 isolation were obtained after written informed consent from adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at the Africa Health Research Institute approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (reference BREC/00001275/2020).

%X The evolution of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants significantly affects vaccine effectiveness. While these effects can only be studied retrospectively, neutralizing antibody titers are most used as correlates of protection. However, studies assessing neutralizing antibody titers often show heterogeneous data. To address this, we investigated assay variance and identified virus infection time and dose as factors affecting assay robustness. We next measured neutralization against Omicron sub-variants in cohorts with hybrid or vaccine induced immunity, identifying a gradient of immune escape potential. To evaluate the effect of individual mutations on this immune escape potential of Omicron variants, we systematically assessed the effect of each individual mutation specific to Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5. We cloned a library of pseudo-viruses expressing spikes with single point mutations, and subjected it to pooled sera from vaccinated hosts, thereby identifying multiple mutations that independently affect neutralization potency. These data might help to predict antigenic features of novel viral variants carrying these mutations and support the development of broad monoclonal antibodies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the COVID-19 Research Network Lower Saxony (COFONI) in the Flex-Funds procedure COFONI-PREMUS (10FF22) and by the project Virological and immunological determinants of COVID-19 pathogenesis-lessons to get prepared for future pandemics (KA1-Co-02 COVIPA), a grant from the Helmholtz Associations Initiative and Networking Fund.

%X The antiviral drug Paxlovid has been shown to rapidly reduce viral load. Coupled with vaccination, timely administration of safe and effective antivirals could provide a path towards managing COVID-19 without restrictive non-pharmaceutical measures. Here, we estimate the population-level impacts of expanding treatment with Paxlovid in the US using a multi-scale mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that incorporates the within-host viral load dynamics of the Omicron variant. We find that, under a low transmission scenario (Re ∼ 1.2) treating 20% of symptomatic cases would be life and cost saving, leading to an estimated 0.26 (95% CrI: 0.03, 0.59) million hospitalizations averted, 30.61 (95% CrI: 1.69, 71.15) thousand deaths averted, and US$52.16 (95% CrI: 2.62, 122.63) billion reduction in health- and treatment-related costs. Rapid and broad use of the antiviral Paxlovid could substantially reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, while averting socioeconomic hardship.Article Summary Line Mass treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 cases with antivirals that rapidly arrest SARS-CoV-2 replication would substantially reduce the spread and burden of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementB.J.C. consults for AstraZeneca, GSK, Moderna, Roche, Sanofi Pasteur, and Pfizer.

%X Objectives Before vaccines and effective treatments were available, quarantine of close contacts was important to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate potential benefits and harms of quarantine, we aimed to estimate infection rates and describe experiences and mental health among persons in mandated quarantine during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Methods We invited adults in mandated quarantine after an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 identified through contact tracing of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, between August 2020 and January 2021. Participants completed two questionnaires and received up to two SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests, during and at the end of quarantine.Results Among 395 participants, quarantine duration ranged from 2 to 20 days. By day 11 since the last contact, 11.1% [95% CI 8.4%–14.7%] were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of participants with symptoms of depression doubled from 9.3% before quarantine to 18.9% during quarantine, and 12.1% reported quarantine was very or extremely difficult.Conclusions Although quarantine was only moderately burdensome for most participants, some experienced significant difficulties and burden. Policymakers need to balance infection control with potential harms placed on individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe ZSAC study was funded through the Health Directorate of the Canton of Zurich and the Pandemic Fund of the University of Zurich. ZSAC was also part of the Corona Immunitas research program, coordinated by the Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+) and funded through SSPH+ fundraising, including funding by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, the Cantons of Switzerland (Basel, Vaud, and Zurich), private funders (ethical guidelines for funding stated by SSPH+ were respected) and institutional funds of the participating universities.

%X CRISPR-based diagnostics have emerged as a promising tool for fast, accurate, and portable pathogen detection. There has been rapid progress in areas such as pre-amplification processes and CRISPR-related enzymes, but the development of reporter systems and reaction platforms has lagged behind. In this paper, we develop new bead-based techniques that can help fill both gaps. First, we develop a novel bead-based split-luciferase reporter system with improved sensitivity compared to standard fluorescence-based reporter design in CRISPR diagnostics. Second, we develop a highly deployable, bead-based platform capable of detecting nine distinct viral targets in parallelized, droplet-based reactions. We demonstrate the enhanced performance of both approaches on synthetic and clinical samples. Together, these systems represent new modalities in CRISPR diagnostics with increased sensitivity, speed, multiplexing, and deployability.Competing Interest StatementS.M.S., N.L.W, J.A.S, C.A., P.C.B., P.C.S., and C.M. are inventors on pending patent applications related to this work, SHINE, and multiplexed Cas13 diagnostics.

%X Objectives To assess the neutralization activity pre and post Omicron BA.1 emergence in a unique cohort of 280 vaccinated restaurant/bar, grocery and hardware store workers in Québec, Canada.Methods Participants were recruited during the emergence of Omicron BA.1 variant. The neutralizing activity of participant sera was assessed by microneutralization assay.Results Serum neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers of all participants against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain was comparable with the response against Delta variant, however, their response was significantly reduced against Omicron BA.1, BA2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5. The neutralizing response of each group of workers was similar. Individuals who received 2 doses of vaccine had significantly reduced NtAb titers against all SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to those infected and then vaccinated (≥1 dose), vaccinated (≥2 doses) and then infected, or those who received 3 doses of vaccine. Participants vaccinated with 2 or 3 doses of vaccine and then infected had the highest NtAb titers against all SARS-CoV-2 strains tested.Conclusion We assessed for the first time the NtAb response in food and retail workers. Individuals infected after ≥2 doses of vaccine had the highest levels of NtAbs against Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5 variants and might be better protected against reinfection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Public Health of Canada through the COVID‐19 Immunity Task Force (CITF) to CG, JP, JFM, DB, ST and MB and the Sentinel North Research Chair at Universite Laval (funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund) as well as the Canada Research Chair to M.B.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Ethics Board (registration number 2021-5744)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Introduction Antivirals with differing mechanisms of action are needed for COVID-19 treatment; remdesivir is mainly used in hospitalized patients, but additional antivirals are needed in this setting. Ensitrelvir, a 3C-like protease inhibitor, received emergency approval in Japan in November 2022, based on evidence of rapid symptom resolution in non-hospitalized patients, but confirmation of its efficacy in hospitalized patients is lacking.Case presentations This case series reports outcomes for all patients who received ensitrelvir whilst hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection at Rinku General Medical Center, Japan (November 2022– April 2023). Thirty-two hospitalized patients received five days of ensitrelvir treatment (375/125 mg). Mean age was 73.5 years and most patients had mild COVID-19. Patients exhibited various underlying diseases, most commonly hypertension (78.1%) and chronic kidney disease (25.0%). Seven (21.9%) patients were on hemodialysis. The most common concomitant medications were antihypertensives (59.4%) and corticosteroids (31.2%); two (6.3%) patients were being treated with rituximab; 27 (84.4%) patients had viral persistence following pre-treatment remdesivir failure. Following ensitrelvir treatment, all patients experienced clinical improvement as assessed by the investigator. No ICU admissions or deaths due to COVID-19 occurred. Viral clearance was recorded in 18 (56.3%) patients by day 5 and 25 (78.1%) patients at final measurement. No new safety signals were observed.Discussion This case series represents ensitrelvir clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 in a real-world setting. Most patients experienced persistent viral shedding despite pre-treatment with antivirals, and most were considered high-risk due to underlying conditions. Despite this, no patients experienced progression of COVID-19 to severe or critical disease, including those who failed prior remdesivir treatment. The antiviral activity of ensitrelvir demonstrated here indicates it is a viable treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infection in this setting.Conclusion Ensitrelvir was associated with potent antiviral activity and positive clinical outcomes in high-risk, hospitalized patients with various comorbidities.Trial Registration UMIN000051300Why carry out this study?Real-world evidence of ensitrelvir for the treatment of COVID-19, especially in inpatient settings, is required.This was a retrospective cohort analysis, consisting of 32 high-risk hospitalized patients with a range of disease severities and comorbidities, including patients who had experienced remdesivir treatment failure.What was learned from the study?All patients experienced clinical improvement following ensitrelvir treatment, without any worsening COVID-19.Viral clearance was documented in 78.1% of patients at final viral measurement.No new safety signals of ensitrelvir were observed in this analysis.Competing Interest StatementMasaya Yamato has received lecture fees from, and serves as an advisor for, Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd..

%X Background The 2022-2023 global mpox outbreak disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM). In Canada, &gt;70% of cases thus far have been among GBM in Montréal, Toronto, and Vancouver. We examined how the distributions of sexual partners 1) varied by city and over time related to the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) were associated with mpox transmission.Methods The Engage Cohort Study (2017-2023) recruited GBM via respondent-driven sampling in Montréal, Toronto, and Vancouver (n=2,449). We compared numbers of sexual partners in the past 6 months across cities and three time periods: pre-COVID-19 pandemic (2017-2019), pandemic (2020-2021), and post-restrictions (2021-2023). We modeled the distribution of sexual partner numbers using Bayesian negative binomial regressions and post-stratification, adjusting for sampling design and attrition. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), secondary attack rate (SAR), and cumulative incidence proportion of mpox using the fitted distributions and case timeseries.Results The pre-COVID-19 pandemic distribution of sexual partner numbers was similar across cities: participants’ mean number of partners was 10.3 (95%CrI: 9.3-11.3) in Montréal, 12.8 (11.1-14.7) in Toronto, and 10.6 (9.41-11.9) in Vancouver. Partner numbers decreased during the pandemic in all cities. Post-restrictions, sexual activity increased but remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Based on reported cases and post-restrictions distributions, the estimated R0 (2.4-2.6) and cumulative incidences (0.6-0.9%) were similar across cities. The estimated average SAR across cities was 79%.Conclusion GBM sexual activity after restrictions were lifted remained below pre-pandemic levels. Comparable sexual partner distributions across cities may explain similarities in mpox R0 and cumulative incidence across cities. Public health authorities should consider the risk of mpox resurgence for future vaccination and surveillance strategies as sexual activity is expected to recover.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Canadian Network for Modeling Infectious Diseases (CANMOD) to SM, MI, and MM-G, and a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to MI, SM, HS, and MM-G.

%X Objective This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among individuals aged 18 years and olderDesign Prospective cohort study.Settings Population-based study was conducted within the Arizona State University (ASU) community.Participants The study recruited 1,397 adult participants that volunteered over a period of three days (March 1-March 3 of 2022).Primary outcome measures Seroprevalence was conducted in the community to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies resulting from previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and/or vaccination.Results The seroprevalence of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies was found to be 96.3% using a semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay and 98% using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. For anti-nucleocapsid (NC) antibodies, the seroprevalence was 39.1% by an ELISA assay and 41.4% by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Individuals that experienced breakthrough infections exhibited the highest levels of anti-RBD antibodies. Additionally, saliva samples showed promise as a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels, as they exhibited a strong correlation with the data obtained from serum samples.Conclusion Accurate estimation of population-based serosurveillance for SARS-CoV- 2 will monitor the trend of infection in the community and delineate the geographical spread of the infection. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during and after outbreaks is crucial for informing the development of effective risk mitigation protocols within the community. Protocols may include measures such as encouraging booster shots, extending mask mandates, or transitioning to online classes. Serosurveys repeated at regular intervals can also guide containment measures in communities and prompt response to future outbreaks.Strengths and limitations of this studyWe simultaneously investigated active infection and seroprevalence for the university population.Our study was strengthened by having the participants’ self-report data independently validated with diagnostic tests.Saliva samples could be a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels.Our study was performed within the university setting therefore it only reflects the COVID-19 situation within that community.The number of breakthrough infections and the longitudinal samples were small, thus requiring confirmation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by Arizona State University Knowledge Enterprise.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Arizona State University Institutional Review Board gave approval for this study.

%X This study investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses in individuals with long COVID (LC) compared to age and gender matched recovered COVID-19 controls (MC) over 24-months. LC participants showed elevated spike and nucleocapsid IgG levels, higher neutralizing capacity, and increased spike- and nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cells, PD-1, and TIM-3 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 3- and 8-months, but these differences did not persist at 24-months. Some LC participants had detectable IFN-γ and IFN-β, that was attributed to reinfection and antigen re-exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing at 24-month timepoint revealed similar immune cell proportions and reconstitution of naïve T and B cell subsets in LC. No significant differences in exhaustion scores or antigen-specific T cell clones were observed. These findings suggest resolution of immune activation in LC and return to comparable immune responses between LC and MC over time. Improvement in self-reported health-related quality of life at 24-months was also evident in the majority of LC (62%). PTX3, CRP levels and platelet count were associated with improvements in health-related quality of life.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe appreciate grant support from the St Vincents Clinic Foundation - the Curran Foundation, the Rapid Response Research Fund (UNSW) - Medical Research Future Fund award GNT 1175865 - - Austin Medical Research Foundation Grant - the Victorian Government - MRFF Award (2005544) - NHMRC program grant (1149990) - NHMRC Fellowships 1136322 and 1123673Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The ADAPT study was approved by the St Vincents Hospital Research Ethics Committee (2020/ETH00964) and is a registered trial (ACTRN12620000554965) - ADAPT-C sub study was approved by the same committee (2020/ETH01429) - All data were stored using REDCap electronic data capture tools - Unexposed healthy donors were recruited through St Vincents Hospital and was approved by St Vincents Hospital Research Ethics Committee (HREC/13/SVH/145)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X We analyzed the kinetics and durability of the humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination using &gt;8,000 longitudinal samples collected over a three-year period (April 2020 – April 2023) in the New York City metropolitan area. Upon primary immunization, participants with pre-existing immunity mounted higher antibody responses faster and achieved higher steady-state levels compared to naïve individuals. Antibody durability was characterized by two phases: an initial rapid decay, followed by a phase of stabilization with very slow decay resulting in an individual spike binding antibody steady state. Booster vaccination equalized the differences in antibody levels between participants with and without hybrid immunity, but the antibody titers reached decreased with each successive antigen exposure. Break-through infections increased antibody titers to similar levels as an additional vaccine dose in naïve individuals. Our study provides strong evidence for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are long lasting, with an initial waning phase followed by a stabilization phase.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%X Waning antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination combined with the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage led to reduced vaccine effectiveness. As a countermeasure, bivalent mRNA-based booster vaccines encoding the ancestral spike protein in combination with that of Omicron BA.1 or BA.5 were introduced. Since then, BA.2-descendent lineages have become dominant, such as XBB.1.5 or BA.2.86. Here, we assessed how different COVID-19 priming regimens affect the immunogenicity of the recently used bivalent booster vaccinations and breakthrough infections. BA.1 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines boosted neutralizing antibodies and T-cells up to 3 months after boost; however, cross-neutralization of XBB.1.5 was poor. Interestingly, different combinations of prime-boost regimens induced divergent responses: participants primed with Ad26.COV2.S developed lower binding antibody levels after bivalent boost while neutralization and T-cell responses were similar to mRNA-based primed participants. In contrast, the breadth of neutralization was higher in mRNA-primed and bivalent BA.5 boosted participants. Combined, we highlight important ‘lessons learned’ from the employed COVID-19 vaccination strategies. Our data further support the use of monovalent vaccines based on circulating strains when vaccinating risk groups, as recently recommended by the WHO. We emphasize the importance of the continuous assessment of immune responses targeting circulating variants to guide future COVID-19 vaccination policies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT05471440Funding StatementNo private funding was received for these studies.

%X To design effective vaccines and other immune interventions against a pathogen, it is necessary to know which aspect of immunity associates with protection. We investigated whether neutralizing antibodies associate with infection clearance in long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection during HIV-mediated immunosuppression. We monitored neutralizing antibody activity against SARS-CoV-2 over 1 to 2 years in five participants with advanced HIV disease and delayed control of HIV viremia. These participants had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from 110 to 289 days which was associated with low or undetectable neutralizing antibody responses. SARS-CoV-2 clearance was associated with the emergence of neutralizing antibodies and occurred in two participants before suppression of HIV viremia, but after some CD4 T cell reconstitution. Vaccination only further increased neutralizing antibody levels in the advanced HIV disease participants who achieved HIV suppression pre-vaccination. During the prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection we observed widespread evolution which was particularly pronounced in one Delta variant infection. This resulted in high-level escape from Delta-elicited neutralizing antibodies and a virus antigenically distinct from both ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron XBB in hamster experimental infections. The results offer new evidence that neutralizing antibodies associate with SARS-CoV-2 clearance and argue that successful management of HIV may be necessary to curtail long-term infection and evolution of co-infecting pathogens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates award INV-018944 (AS), Wellcome Trust Award 226137/Z/22/Z (AS and PLM) and the South African Medical Research Council (AS and PLM).

%X The outbreak of COVID-19 unleashed an unprecedented global pandemic, leaving a profound impact on lives and economies worldwide. Recognizing its severity, the World Health Organization swiftly declared it a public health emergency of international concern. Tragically, the Philippines reported the first death case outside China, leading to a surge in cases following the first instance of local transmission. In response to this crisis, collaborative efforts have been underway to control the disease and minimize its health and socio-economic impacts. The COVID-19 epidemic curve holds vital insights into the history of exposure, transmission, testing, tracing, social distancing measures, community lockdowns, quarantine, isolation, and treatment, offering a comprehensive perspective on the nation’s response. One approach to gaining crucial insights is through meticulous analysis of available datasets, empowering us to inform future strategies and responses effectively. This paper aims to provide descriptive data analytics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, summarizing the country’s fight by visualizing epidemiological and mobility datasets, revisiting scientific papers and news articles, and creating a timeline of the key issues faced during the pandemic. By leveraging these multifaceted analyses, policymakers and health authorities can make informed decisions to enhance preparedness, expand inter-agency cooperation, and combat future public health crises effectively. This study seeks to serve as a valuable resource, guiding nations worldwide in comprehending and responding to the challenges posed by COVID-19 and beyond.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int/); Department of Health of the Philippines (https://doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker); Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations); Google, Covid-19 community mobility reports, (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Recurring COVID-19 waves highlight the need for tools able to quantify transmission risk, and identify geographical areas at risk of outbreaks. Local outbreak risk depends on complex immunity patterns resulting from previous infections, vaccination, waning and immune escape, alongside other factors (population density, social contact patterns). Immunity patterns are spatially and demographically heterogeneous, and are challenging to capture in country-level forecast models.Methods We used a spatiotemporal regression model to forecast subnational case and death counts and applied it to three EU countries as test cases: France, Czechia, and Italy. Cases in local regions arise from importations or local transmission. Our model produces age-stratified forecasts given age-stratified data, and links reported case counts to routinely collected covariates (test number, vaccine coverage..). We assessed the predictive performance of our model up to four weeks ahead using proper scoring rules and compared it to the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble model. Using simulations, we evaluated the impact of variations in transmission on the forecasts. We developed an open-source RShiny App to visualise the forecasts and scenarios.Results At a national level, the median relative difference between our median weekly case forecasts and the data up to four weeks ahead was 25% (IQR: 12-50%) over the prediction period. The accuracy decreased as the forecast horizon increased (on average 24% increase in the median ranked probability score per added week), while the accuracy of death forecasts remained stable. Beyond two weeks, the model generated a narrow range of likely transmission dynamics. The median national case forecasts showed similar accuracy to forecasts from the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble model, but the prediction interval was narrower in our model. Generating forecasts under alternative transmission scenarios was therefore key to capturing the range of possible short-term transmission dynamics.Discussion Our model captures changes in local COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, and enables quantification of short-term transmission risk at a subnational level. The outputs of the model improve our ability to identify areas where outbreaks are most likely, and are available to a wide range of public health professionals through the Shiny App we developed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work received funding from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) via the specific contract "Analysis of COVID-19 outbreak risk at subnational level in the vaccine era: development of an RShiny app" (REOP/2021/SMS/13060) under the framework contract "Mathematical Modelling &amp; Economic Evaluation" (OJ-2019-SRS-10962).

%X As COVID-19 vaccines became abundantly available around the world since the second half of 2021, many countries carried out a vaccination certificate (green pass) policy to encourage vaccination and help reopen their economies. This policy granted certified people more freedom of gathering and movement than unvaccinated individuals. Accordingly, pre-existing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were adjusted under the vaccination certificate policy. The vaccination certificate also induced heterogeneous behaviors between unvaccinated and vaccinated groups, which complicates the modeling of COVID-19 transmission. Still, limited work is available in evaluating the impact of the green pass policy on COVID-19 transmission using quantitative methods. To characterize the major changes caused by the green pass policy, a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemiological model SEIQRD2 is proposed in this paper. By integrating different behavior patterns of unvaccinated and vaccinated groups under the green pass policy, SEIQRD2 adopts the inherent variability and complexity of human behaviors in the context of vaccination and NPIs and their effect on COVID-19 transmissions. Three countries: Greece, Austria, and Israel are selected as case studies to demonstrate the validity of SEIQRD2.

%T Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Variant-Specific Serum Antibodies Post-Vaccination Utilizing Immortalized Human Hepatocyte-like Cells (HLC) to Assess Development of Protective Immunity

%X Background Our previous studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins could bind to hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor-1 (ASGR-1) facilitating direct infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Immortalized E12-HLC expressed the phenotypic and biological properties of primary human hepatocytes, including their ability to bind spike proteins via ASGR-1 with exception of the spike 1 protein. This binding could be inhibited by spike protein-specific monoclonal antibodies. We used the same spike-blocking analysis to determine if post-vaccination serum was capable of blocking spike protein binding to HLC. Samples collected from subjects prior to, and post-vaccination were quantified for anti-variant-specific antibody (original wild type, alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ) and delta (δ) variants) by a flow cytometry based immunofluorescent assay. Inhibition of variant spike protein binding to HLC and AT-2 (as a known model for spike 1 binding to the ACE-2 receptor) was analyzed by confocal microscopy. This study was designed to investigate the ability of post-vaccination antibodies to mediate immunity to spike S2, and to validate the utility of the E12-HLC in analyzing that immunity.Methods Serum was collected from 10 individuals pre- and post-vaccination with the J&amp;J, Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. The serum samples were quantified for variant-specific antibodies in a flow cytometry-based immunofluorescent assay utilizing beads coated with biotinylated variant spike proteins (α, β, γ, δ). Presence of variant-specific antibodies was visualized by anti-human IgG-Alexa 488. Inhibition of spike protein binding to cells was analyzed by immunofluorescent confocal analysis. Biotinylated variant spike proteins were preincubated with serum samples and then tested for binding to target cells. Binding was visualized by Streptavidin-Alexa 594. Results were compared to binding of unblocked spike variants.Results All variant spike proteins tested bound to both the HLC and AT-2 cells. Pre-vaccination serum samples had no detectable reactivity to any of the variant spike proteins and were unable to inhibit binding of the variant spike proteins to either target cell. Post-vaccination serum samples demonstrated a progression of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels from low early post-vaccination levels to higher levels at 2.5 months after vaccination. Concurrently, serum samples taken at those different timeframes demonstrated that serum obtained from shortly after vaccination were not as effective in blocking spike protein as serum obtained after 2.5 months post-vaccination. Antibody concentrations were not necessarily associated with better blocking of spike protein binding as spike variant-specific serum antibody concentrations varied significantly between subjects and within each subject. It was also demonstrated that vaccination with all the various available vaccines stimulated antibodies that inhibited binding of the available variant spike proteins to both HLC and AT-2 cells.Conclusion HLC, along with AT-2 cells, provides a useful platform to study the development of protective antibodies that prevent the binding SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to target cells. It was shown that vaccination with the three available vaccines all elicited serum antibodies that were protective against binding of each of the variant spike proteins to both AT-2 and HLC cells. This study suggests that analysis of immune serum to block spike binding to target cells may be a more useful technique to assess protective immunity than quantitation of gross antibody alone.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by CMDG, LLC.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Cells that were generated (MLPC, HLC and AT-2) and other tissues (cord blood and peripheral blood samples) used in this study received IRB approval by the Quorum Review Protocol #800, March 3, 2005.

%X Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, virus evolution and large-scale vaccination programs have caused multiple exposures to SARS CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in complex antibody profiles. Binding of sera to spike protein of future variants in the context of heterogeneous exposure, has not been studied. We tested archival sera (delta and omicron period) stratified by anti-spike levels for reactivity to omicron subvariant (BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75, BA.4/5 and BF.7) spike. Antibody reactivity to wild-type (CLIA) and subvariants (ELISA) spike were similar between periods (p&gt;0.05). Both High S group and Low S group of delta and omicron periods were closely related to future subvariants by Antigenic Cartography. Anti-spike antibodies to wild type (S1/S2 and Trimeric S) clustered with subvariant-binding antibodies. Low S group interspersed between High S group on hierarchical clustering. Hybrid immunity caused by cumulative virus exposure in delta or omicron periods caused equivalent binding to future variants. Low S antibody group demonstrating similar binding is a prominent finding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementMahesh Moorthy acknowledges Department of Biotechnology, India for financial support through BT/PR40390/COT/142/1/2020.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the need for devices capable of carrying out rapid differential detection of viruses that may manifest similar physiological symptoms yet demand tailored treatment plans. Seasonal influenza may be exacerbated by COVID-19 infections, increasing the burden on healthcare systems. In this work, we demonstrate a technology, based on liquid-gated graphene field-effect transistors, for rapid and ultraprecise detection and differentiation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 surface protein. Most distinctively, our device consists of 4 onboard graphene field-effect electrolyte-gated transistors arranged in a quadruple architecture, where each quarter is functionalized individually (with either antibodies or chemically passivated control) but measured collectively. Our sensor platform was tested against a range of concentrations of viral surface proteins from both viruses with the lowest tested and detected concentration at ∼50 ag/mL, or 88 zM for COVID-19 and 227 zM for Flu, which is 5-fold lower than the values reported previously on a similar platform. Unlike the classic Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, which has a turnaround time of a few hours, our technology presents an ultrafast response time of ∼10 seconds even in complex media such as saliva. Thus, we have developed a multi-analyte, highly sensitive, and fault-tolerant technology for rapid diagnostic of contemporary, emerging, and future pandemics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Awards #2033846 and #2222907, and the University of Texas ECE departmental research funds.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Despite vaccination and antiviral therapies, immunocompromised individuals are at risk for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the immune defects that predispose to persistent COVID-19 remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed detailed viro-immunologic analyses of a prospective cohort of participants with COVID-19. The median time to nasal viral RNA and culture clearance in the severe hematologic malignancy/transplant group (S-HT) were 72 and 40 days, respectively, which were significantly longer than clearance rates in the severe autoimmune/B-cell deficient (S-A), non-severe, and non-immunocompromised groups (P&lt;0.001). Participants who were severely immunocompromised had greater SARS-CoV-2 evolution and a higher risk of developing antiviral treatment resistance. Both S-HT and S-A participants had diminished SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral, while only the S-HT group had reduced T cell-mediated responses. This highlights the varied risk of persistent COVID-19 across immunosuppressive conditions and suggests that suppression of both B and T cell responses results in the highest contributing risk of persistent infection.Competing Interest StatementDr. JZ Li was supported by a grant from Merck.

%X The Orthocoronaviridae subfamily is large comprising four highly divergent genera. Four seasonal coronaviruses were circulating in humans prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Infection with these viruses induced antibody responses that are relatively narrow with little cross-reactivity to spike proteins of other coronaviruses. Here, we report that infection with and vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces broadly crossreactive binding antibodies to spikes from a wide range of coronaviruses including members of the sarbecovirus subgenus, betacoronaviruses including Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), and extending to alpha-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus spikes. These data show that the coronavirus spike antibody landscape in humans has profoundly been changed and broadened as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While we do not understand the functionality of these crossreactive antibodies, they may lead to enhanced resistance of the population to infection with newly emerging coronaviruses with pandemic potential.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%X The etiologic mechanisms of post-acute medical morbidities and unexplained symptoms (Long COVID) following SARS-CoV-2 infection are incompletely understood. There is growing evidence that viral persistence and immune dysregulation may play a major role. We performed whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a cohort of 24 participants at time points ranging from 27 to 910 days following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel radiopharmaceutical agent, [18F]F-AraG, a highly selective tracer that allows for anatomical quantitation of activated T lymphocytes. Tracer uptake in the post-acute COVID group, which included those with and without Long COVID symptoms, was significantly higher compared to pre-pandemic controls in many anatomical regions, including the brain stem, spinal cord, bone marrow, nasopharyngeal and hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissues, and gut wall. Although T cell activation tended to be higher in participants imaged closer to the time of the acute illness, tracer uptake was increased in participants imaged up to 2.5 years following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that T cell activation in spinal cord and gut wall was associated with the presence of Long COVID symptoms. In addition, tracer uptake in lung tissue was higher in those with persistent pulmonary symptoms. Notably, increased T cell activation in these tissues was also observed in many individuals without Long COVID. Given the high [18F]F-AraG uptake detected in the gut, we obtained colorectal tissue for in situ hybridization SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immunohistochemical studies in a subset of participants with Long COVID symptoms. We identified cellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA in rectosigmoid lamina propria tissue in all these participants, ranging from 158 to 676 days following initial COVID-19 illness, suggesting that tissue viral persistence could be associated with long-term immunological perturbations.Competing Interest StatementMJP reports consulting fees for Gilead Sciences and AstraZeneca, outside the submitted work.

%X The speed of spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the importance of understanding how infections are transmitted in a highly connected world. Prior to vaccination, changes in human mobility patterns were used as non-pharmaceutical interventions to eliminate or suppress viral transmission. The rapid spread of respiratory viruses, various intervention approaches, and the global dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 underscore the necessity for epidemiological models that incorporate mobility to comprehend the spread of the virus. Here, we introduce a metapopulation susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR) model parameterised with human movement data from 340 cities in China. Our model replicates the early case trajectory in the COVID-19 pandemic. We then use machine learning algorithms to determine which network properties best predict spread between cities and find travel time to be most important, followed by the human movement Weighted Personalised PageRank. However, we show that travel time is most influential locally, after which the high connectivity between cities reduces the impact of travel time between individual cities on transmission speed. Additionally, we demonstrate that only significantly reduced movement substantially impacts infection spread times throughout the network.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Bryce Carmine and Anne Carmine, through the Massey University Foundation(RM22688)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Key to understanding COVID-19 correlates of protection is assessing vaccine-induced immunity in different demographic groups. Sex- and age-specific immune differences have a wide impact on outcomes from infections and immunisations. Typically, adult females make stronger immune responses and have better disease outcomes but suffer more adverse events following vaccination and are more prone to autoimmune disease. To understand better the mechanisms underlying these differences in vaccine responses, we studied immune responses to two doses of BNT162b2 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in an adolescent cohort (n=34, ages 12-16), an age group previously shown to make significantly greater immune responses to the same vaccine compared to young adults. At the same time, we were able to evaluate immune responses to the co-administered live attenuated influenza vaccine, which has been shown to induce stronger immune responses in adult females. Blood samples from 34 adolescents taken pre- and post-vaccination with COVID-19 and influenza vaccines were assayed for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralising antibodies, and cellular immunity specific for SARS-CoV-2 and endemic betacoronaviruses. IgG targeting influenza lineages contained in the influenza vaccine was also assessed. As previously demonstrated, total IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens were significantly higher among vaccinated adolescents compared to adults (aged 32-52) who received the BNT162b2 vaccine (comparing infection-naïve, 49,696 vs 33,339; p=0.03; comparing SARS-CoV-2 previously-infected, 743,691 vs 269,985; p&lt;0.0001) by MSD v-plex assay. However, unexpectedly, antibody responses to BNT162b2 and the live-attenuated influenza vaccine were not higher among female adolescents compared to males; among infection-naïve adolescents, antibody responses to BNT162b2 were higher in males than females (62,270 vs 36,951 p=0.008). No sex difference was identified in vaccinated adults. These unexpected findings may result from the introduction of novel mRNA vaccination platforms, generating patterns of immunity divergent from established trends, and providing new insights into what might be protective following COVID-19 vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementP.K. is is funded by WT109965MA and is an NIHR Senior Investigator.

%X Central Michigan University (CMU) participated in a state-wide SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring program since 2021. Wastewater samples were collected from on-campus sites and nine off-campus wastewater treatment plants servicing small metropolitan and rural communities. SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were quantified using droplet digital PCR and results were reported to the health department. One rural, off-campus site consistently produced higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies. Samples from this site were sequenced and initially contained predominately Alpha variant lineage Q.3, which transitioned to lineage Q.4. Alpha variant lineage Q.3/Q.4 was detected at this site beginning in fall 2021 and continued until summer 2023. Mutational analysis of reconstructed genes revealed divergence from the Alpha variant lineage Q.3 clinical sequence over time, including numerous mutations in the surface glycoprotein RBD and NTD. We discuss the possibility that a chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection accumulated adaptive mutations that promoted long-term infection. This study reveals that small wastewater treatment plants can enhance resolution of rare events and facilitate reconstruction of viral genomes due to the relative lack of contaminating sequences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded by a grant from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Wastewater surveillance data is available on MDHHS's SWEEP and CDC NWSS dashboards.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Pandemic preparedness requires institutions, including public health authorities and governments, to detect, survey and control outbreaks. To maintain an accurate, quantitative and up-to-date picture of an epidemic crisis is key. For SARS-CoV-2, this was mostly achieved by ascertaining incidence numbers and the effective reproductive number (Reff), which counts how many people an infected person is likely to infect on average. These numbers give strong hints on past infection dynamics in a population but fail to clearly characterize current and future dynamics as well as potential effects of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. We show that, by using and combining infection surveillance and population-scale contact statistics, we can obtain a better understanding of the drivers of epidemic waves and the effectiveness of interventions. This approach can provide a real-time picture, thus saving not only many lives by quickly allowing adaptation of the health policies but also alleviating economic and other burdens if an intervention proves ineffective. We factorize Reff into contacts and relative transmissibility: Both signals can be used, individually and combined, to identify driving forces of an epidemic, monitoring and assessing interventions, as well as projecting an epidemic’s future trajectory. Using data for SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza from 2019 onward in Germany, we provide evidence for the usefulness of our approach. In particular, we find that the effects from physical distancing and lockdowns as well as vaccination campaigns are dominant.Competing Interest StatementThis work was supported by grants from the Federal Government of Germany through the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) for the project DAKI-FWS (01MK21009A) and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for the project OptimAgent (031L0299).

%X The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostic testing relies on RNA extraction from naso/oropharyngeal swab followed by amplification through RT-PCR with fluorogenic probes. While the test is extremely sensitive and specific, its high cost and the potential discomfort associated with specimen collection make it suboptimal for public health screening purposes.In this study, we developed an equally reliable, but cheaper and less invasive alternative test based on a one-step RT-PCR with the DNA-intercalating dye SYBR Green, which enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples or RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs. Importantly, we found that this type of testing can be fine-tuned to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.The saliva RT-PCR SYBR Green test was successfully used in a mass-screening initiative targeting nearly 4500 asymptomatic children under the age of 12. Testing was performed at a reasonable cost of less than € 0.8 per child, and in some cases, the saliva test outperformed nasopharyngeal rapid antigen tests in identifying infected children. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the antigen testing failure could not be attributed to a specific lineage of SARS-CoV-2.To further reduce testing costs, we produced all the necessary enzymes and established a new RT-PCR protocol based on the EvaGreen dye. Overall, this work strongly supports the view that RT-PCR saliva tests based on DNA-intercalating dyes represent a powerful strategy for community screening of SARS-CoV-2. The tests can be easily applied to other infectious agents and, therefore, constitute a powerful resource for an effective response to future pandemics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by (i) Project LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER-007660 (Microbiologia Molecular, Estrutural e Celular) funded by FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI), (ii) Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) through the project DETECT Ref 433_613549914 (20/7/153), under the scope of the 2nd edition of the programme RESEARCH4COVID19, (iii) the project STOP-COVID Strategies to prevent COVID-19 by early detection of asymptomatic carriers at increased risk: epidemiological studies and validation of a rapid in-house diagnostic test, Ref 072559, funded by FEDER Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional from Programa Operacional Regional Lisboa and (iv) the Municipality of OeirasAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval was given by the Institutional Review Board of Hospital das Forcas Armadas (HFA), Portugal, (samples collected at HFA) or by the Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical (IHMT) - Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica (ITQB NOVA) Ethics Committee (samples collected at Fundicao de Oeiras), Portugal.

%X Background The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seen several variants of concern, including the Omicron (BA.1) variant which emerged in October 2021. Accurately estimating the incubation period of these variants is crucial for predicting disease spread and formulating effective public health strategies. However, existing estimates often conflict because of biases arising from the dynamic nature of epidemic growth and selective inclusion of cases. This study aims to accurately estimate of the Omicron (BA.1) variant incubation period based on data from Taiwan, where disease incidence remained low and contact tracing was comprehensive during the first months of the Omicron outbreak.Methods We reviewed 100 contact-tracing records for cases of the Omicron BA.1 variant reported between December 2021 and January 2022, and found enough information to analyze 70 of these. The incubation period distribution was estimated by fitting data on exposure and symptom onset within a Bayesian mixture model using gamma, Weibull, and lognormal distributions as candidates. Additionally, a systematic literature search was conducted to accumulate data for estimates of the incubation period for Omicron (BA.1/2, BA.4/5) subvariants, which was then used for meta-analysis and comparison.Results The mean incubation period was estimated at 3.5 days (95% credible interval: 3.1–4.0 days), with no clear differences when stratified by vaccination status or age. This estimate aligns closely with the pooled mean of 3.4 days (3.0–3.8 days) obtained from a meta-analysis of other published studies on Omicron subvariants.Conclusions The relatively shorter incubation period of the Omicron variant, as compared to previous SARS-CoV2 variants, implies its potential for rapid spread but also opens the possibility for individuals to voluntarily adopt shorter, more resource-efficient quarantine periods. Continual updates to incubation period estimates, utilizing data from comprehensive contact tracing, are crucial for effectively guiding these voluntary actions and adjusting high socio-economic cost interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (NSTC #111-2314-B-002-289).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University (Approval number: 202304HM020).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Ghana reported the first COVID-19 cases on 12 March 2020. Response actions were rolled out along seven thematic pillars to limit the importation, detect and contain the virus, effectively manage cases, ensure effective coordination and maintain essential services. A whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach was adopted for the response. The government instituted restriction measures at various stages of the response to contain the pandemic or limit the impact of the pandemic on the health, social and economic wellbeing of the citizens. Four distinct transmission waves were recorded within the first 2 years of the pandemic. The study examined the key drivers of the major waves.Methods A descriptive analysis of the pandemic from March 2020 to March 2022 was conducted using data reported through the country’s COVID-19 surveillance platforms. All RT-PCR confirmed cases reported from the 16 administrative regions over the two-year period were analysed. The effective reproduction number was computed using a model developed by Cori and colleagues.Results A total of 160,761 cases with 99.1% (159,227) recoveries or discharges were reported as of 12 March 2022. The Greater Accra Region reported 56.3% of the confirmed cases. Within the period, 1,445 deaths (CFR= 0.9%) were reported. Approximately 2.3 million tests (76,774 per million population) tests were conducted with a cumulative test positivity rate of 6.8%. COVID-19 vaccination was enrolled a year after the first cases were reported and 21.3% of the target population was fully vaccinated as of 12 March 2022. Ghana recorded four major COVID-19 transmission waves characterized mainly by variants of concern and sub-optimal adherence to the public health and social measures.Conclusion Scaling up and enhancing community acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination as well optimizing the current surveillance and response systems are essential is sustaining the current gains and limiting the emergence of new variants of concern.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThere was no financial support from any entity for this piece of workAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.Not ApplicableThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ghana Health ServiceI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.Not ApplicableI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a Mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid excreted in urine, and a target biomarker of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for tuberculosis (TB) disease. Urine LAM (uLAM) testing by RDT has been approved for people living with HIV, but there is limited data regarding uLAM levels in HIV-negative adults with TB disease. We conducted a clinical study of adults presenting with TB-related symptoms at the National Lung Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. The uLAM concentrations were measured using electrochemiluminescent immunoassays and compared to a microbiological reference standard (MRS) of sputum, GeneXpert Ultra and TB culture. Additional microbiological testing was conducted for possible extrapulmonary TB, when clinically indicated. Among 745 participants enrolled, 335 (44.9 %) participants recruited from the pulmonary TB wards (PR-PTBW) and 6 (11.3%) participants recruited from the EPTB wards (PR-EPTBW) had confirmed TB disease. The MRS positive cohort measured median uLAM concentration for S4-20/A194-01 (S/A) were 14.5 pg/mL and 51.5 pg/mL, respectively. The FIND28/A194-01 (F/A) antibody pair overall and TB-positive cohort measured mean uLAM was 44.4 pg/mL and 78.1 pg/mL, respectively. Overall, the S/A antibody pair had a sensitivity of 39% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.33, 0.44) and specificity of 97% (95% CI 0.96, 0.99) against the MRS. The F/A antibody pair had a sensitivity of 41% (95% CI 0.35, 0.47) and specificity of 79% (95% CI 0.75, 0.84). The areas under the receiver operating curves were 0.748 for S/A and 0.629 for F/A. There was little difference between the S/A median uLAM concentration with pulmonary (55 pg/mL) and extrapulmonary (36 pg/mL) TB disease. With F/A the medians for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB disease were 79% and 76.5% respectively. Among HIV-negative adults in Vietnam, concentrations of uLAM remained relatively low for people with TB disease, which may present challenges for developing a more sensitive rapid uLAM test.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementDSB was the sole recipient of the award to perform this study.

%X Introduction While older adults generally mount weaker antibody responses to a primary COVID-19 vaccine series, T-cell responses remain less well characterized in this population. We compared SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T-cell responses after two- and three-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and subsequent breakthrough infection in older and younger adults.Methods We quantified CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells reactive to overlapping peptides spanning the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 40 older adults (median age 79) and 50 younger health care workers (median age 39), all COVID-19 naive, using an activation induced marker assay. T-cell responses were further assessed in 24 participants, including 8 older adults, who subsequently experienced their first SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection.Results A third COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose significantly boosted spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell frequencies to above two-dose levels in older and younger adults. T-cell frequencies did not significantly differ between older and younger adults after either dose. Multivariable analyses adjusting for sociodemographic, health and vaccine-related variables confirmed that older age was not associated with impaired cellular responses. Instead, the strongest predictors of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell frequencies post-third-dose were their corresponding post-second-dose frequencies. Breakthrough infection significantly increased both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies, to comparable levels in older and younger adults. Exploratory analyses revealed an association between HLA-A*02:03 and higher post-vaccination CD8+ T-cell frequencies, which may be attributable to numerous strong-binding HLA-A*02:03-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes in spike.Conclusion Older adults mount robust T-cell responses to two- and three-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, which are further boosted following breakthrough infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada through a COVID-19 Immunology Task Force COVID-19 "Hot Spots" Award (2020-HQ-000120 to MGR, ZLB, MAB).

%X Environmental testing of high-touch objects is a potential noninvasive approach for monitoring population-level trends of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses within a defined setting. We aimed to determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 contamination on high-touch environmental surfaces, community level case incidence, and university student health data. Environmental swabs were collected from January 2022 to November 2022 from high-touch objects and surfaces from five locations on a large university campus in Florida, USA. RT-qPCR was used to detect and quantify viral RNA, and a subset of positive samples was analyzed by viral genome sequencing to identify circulating lineages. During the study period, we detected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA on 90.7% of 162 tested samples. Levels of environmental viral RNA correlated with trends in community-level activity and case reports from the student health center. A significant positive correlation was observed between the estimated viral gene copy number in environmental samples and the weekly confirmed cases at the university. Viral sequencing data from environmental samples identified lineages contemporaneously circulating in the local community and state based on genomic surveillance data. Further, we detected emerging variants in environmental samples prior to their identification by clinical genomic surveillance. Our results demonstrate the utility of viral monitoring on high-touch environmental surfaces for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance at a community level. In communities with delayed or limited testing facilities, immediate environmental surface testing may considerably inform epidemic dynamics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded in part by a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to the University of Florida and the University of Central Florida in order to accelerate regional genomic surveillance.

%T Design and Analysis Heterogeneity in Observational Studies of COVID-19 Booster Effectiveness: A Review and Case Study

%X Background Observational vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies based on real-world data are a crucial supplement to initial randomized clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. However, there exists substantial heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods for estimating VE. The impact of such heterogeneity on VE estimates is not clear.Methods We conducted a two-step literature review of booster VE: a literature search for first or second monovalent boosters on January 1, 2023, and a rapid search for bivalent boosters on March 28, 2023. For each study identified, study design, methods, and VE estimates for infection, hospitalization, and/or death were extracted and summarized via forest plots. We then applied methods identified in the literature to a single dataset from Michigan Medicine (MM), providing a comparison of the impact of different statistical methodologies on the same dataset.Results We identified 53 studies estimating VE of the first booster, 16 for the second booster. Of these studies, 2 were case-control, 17 were test-negative, and 50 were cohort studies. Together, they included nearly 130 million people worldwide. VE for all outcomes was very high (around 90%) in earlier studies (i.e., in 2021), but became attenuated and more heterogeneous over time (around 40%-50% for infection, 60%-90% for hospitalization, and 50%-90% for death). VE compared to the previous dose was lower for the second booster (10-30% for infection, 30-60% against hospitalization, and 50-90% against death). We also identified 11 bivalent booster studies including over 20 million people. Early studies of the bivalent booster showed increased effectiveness compared to the monovalent booster (VE around 50-80% for hospitalization and death).Our primary analysis with MM data using a cohort design included 186,495 individuals overall (including 153,811 boosted and 32,684 with only a primary series vaccination), and a secondary test-negative design included 65,992 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. When different statistical designs and methods were applied to MM data, VE estimates for hospitalization and death were robust to analytic choices, with test-negative designs leading to narrower confidence intervals. Adjusting either for the propensity of getting boosted or directly adjusting for covariates reduced the heterogeneity across VE estimates for the infection outcome.Conclusion While the advantage of the second monovalent booster is not obvious from the literature review, the first monovalent booster and the bivalent booster appear to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19. Based on both the literature view and data analysis, VE analyses with a severe disease outcome (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) appear to be more robust to design and analytic choices than an infection endpoint. Test-negative designs can extend to severe disease outcomes and may offer advantages in statistical efficiency when used properly.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was supported by NSF DMS 1712933 and NIH/NIGMS R01GM139926.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical review and approval were waived for this study because of its qualification for a federal exemption as secondary research for which consent is not required.

%X Background Hong Kong contained COVID-19 for two years, but experienced a large epidemic of Omicron BA.2 in early 2022 and endemic transmission of Omicron subvariants thereafter.Methods We examined the use and impact of pandemic controls in Hong Kong by analysing data on more than 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and characterizing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions implemented from January 2020 through to 30 December 2022. We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) to track changes in transmissibility and effectiveness of community-based measures against infection over time. We examined the temporal changes of pharmaceutical interventions, mortality rate and case-fatality risks (CFRs), particularly among older adults.Findings Hong Kong experienced four local epidemic waves predominated by the ancestral strain in 2020 and early 2021 and prevented multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from spreading in the community before 2022. Strict travel-related, case-based, and community-based measures were increasingly tightened in Hong Kong over the first two years of the pandemic. However, even very stringent measures were unable to contain the spread of Omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong. Despite high overall vaccination uptake (&gt;70% with at least two doses), high mortality was observed during the Omicron BA.2 wave due to lower vaccine coverage (42%) among adults ≥65 years of age. Increases in antiviral usage and vaccination uptake over time through 2022 was associated with decreased case fatality risks.Interpretation Integrated strict measures were able to reduce importation risks and interrupt local transmission to contain COVID-19 transmission and disease burden while awaiting vaccine development and rollout. Increasing coverage of pharmaceutical interventions among high-risk groups reduced infection-related mortality and mitigated the adverse health impact of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementBJC consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GSK, Haleon, Moderna, Pfizer, Roche, and Sanofi Pasteur.

%T Omicron vs. the Rest: Assessing the Competitive Dynamics and Coinfection Scenarios of COVID-19 Strains on a Social Network

%X The rapid spread and evolving nature of COVID-19 variants have raised concerns regarding their competitive dynamics and coinfection scenarios. In this study, we assess the competitive interactions between the Omicron variant and other prominent variants (Alpha, Beta, and Delta) on a social network, considering both single infection and coinfection states. Using the SIRS model, we simulate the progression of these variants and analyze their impact on infection rates, mortality, and overall disease burden. Our findings demonstrate that the Alpha and Beta strains exhibit comparable contagion levels, with the Alpha strain displaying higher infection and mortality rates. Moreover, the Delta strain emerges as the most prevalent and virulent strain, surpassing the other variants. When introduced alongside the less virulent Omicron strain, the Delta strain results in higher infection and mortality rates. However, the Omicron strain’s dominance leads to an overall increase in disease statistics. Remarkably, our study highlights the efficacy of the Omicron variant in supplanting more virulent strains and its potential role in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. The Omicron strain demonstrates a competitive advantage over the other variants, suggesting its potential to reduce the severity of the disease and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 variants, as they can inform effective prevention and mitigation strategies, particularly with the emergence of variants that possess a relative advantage in controlling disease transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:NAI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Novel mRNA vaccines have resulted in a reduced number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and hospitalizations. Yet, there is a paucity of studies regarding their effectiveness on immunocompromised autoimmune subjects. In this study, we enrolled subjects naïve to SARS-CoV-2 infections from two cohorts of healthy donors (HD, n=56) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=69). Serological assessments of their circulating antibodies revealed a significant reduction of potency and breadth of neutralization in the SLE group, only partially rescued by a 3rd booster dose. Immunological memory responses in the SLE cohort were characterized by a reduced magnitude of spike-reactive B and T cell responses that were strongly associated with poor seroconversion.Vaccinated SLE subjects were defined by a distinct expansion and persistence of a DN2 spike-reactive memory B cell pool and a contraction of spike-specific memory cTfh cells, contrasting with the sustained germinal center (GC)-driven activity mediated by mRNA vaccination in the healthy population. Among the SLE-associated factors that dampened the vaccine responses, treatment with the monoclonal antibody anti-BAFF/Belimumab (a lupus FDA-approved B cell targeting agent) profoundly affected the vaccine responsiveness by restricting the de novo B cell responses and promoting stronger extra-follicular (EF)-mediated responses that were associated with poor immunogenicity and impaired immunological memory.In summary, this study interrogates antigen-specific responses and characterized the immune cell landscape associated with mRNA vaccination in SLE. The identification of factors associated with reduced vaccine efficacy illustrates the impact of SLE B cell biology on mRNA vaccine responses and provides guidance for the management of boosters and recall vaccinations in SLE patients according to their disease endotype and modality of treatment.Competing Interest StatementCompeting interests F.E.L. is the founder of MicroB-plex, Inc., and has research grants with Genentech.Funding StatementThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants: U54- 762 CA260563-01 Emory SeroNet (I.S., F.E.L.), U19-AI110483 Emory Autoimmunity Center of Excellence (I.S.).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Human participants.

%X Background T cell immunity is key for the control of viral infections including SARS-CoV-2, in particular with regard to immune memory and protection against arising genetic variants.Method We recently evaluated a peptide-based SARS-CoV-2 T cell activator termed CoVac-1 in a first-in-human clinical trial and observed a favorable safety profile and induction of poly-specific T cell responses until month 3. Here, we report on long-term safety and efficacy data of CoVac-1 in healthy adults until month 12.Findings CoVac-1 is well tolerated without long-term immune-related side effects and induces long-lasting anti-viral T cell responses in 100% of study participants. Potent expandability of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeting multiple different CoVac-1 T cell epitopes was observed 6 and 12 months after one single dose of CoVac-1. T cell responses were associated with the severity and the number of local adverse events at injection site. Beyond induction of T cell immunity, 89% of study participants developed CoVac-1-specific IgG antibody titers which associated with the intensity of the T cell response, indicating that CoVac-1-specific CD4+ T cells support the induction of B cell responses. Vaccination with approved COVID-19 vaccines boosted CoVac-1-specific T cell responses. Overall, a low SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was observed in the study population (8.3% of participants until month 12).Interpretation Together, a single application of CoVac-1 elicits long-lived and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity, which further supports the current evaluation of our T cell activator in patients with congenital or acquired B cell defects (NCT04954469).Funding This trial is funded by the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden- Württemberg., GermanyEvidence before this study T cells have an important role for COVID-19 outcome and maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, even in the absence of humoral immune responses. Thus, the induction of SARS-CoV-2 T cell immunity is a central goal for vaccine development and of particular importance for patients with congenital or acquired B cell deficiencies. We developed the peptide-based T-cell activator CoVac-1, composed of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes derived from various viral proteins. In a Phase I trial in healthy adults, CoVac-1 induced profound T-cell immunity after single dose administration in 100% of participants. The multifunctional Th1CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response induced by CoVac-1 surpassed those occurring after naturally SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as after vaccination with approved vaccines.Added value of this study Here we present the final data of our Phase I trial, evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of CoVac-1 until 12 months after administration. CoVac-1 is well tolerated without long-term immune-related side effects and induces long-lasting and broad anti-viral T cell responses in all study participants, which associate with low-infection rate in the study population.Implications of all the available evidence Various vaccines have been approved to prevent severe COVID-19, primarily designed to induce a spike-specific humoral immune response. CoVac-1 is the first T-cell activator for induction of broad and sustained SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity.

%X Since its emergence in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally, causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the fall of 2020, the Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) was detected in England and spread rapidly, outcompeting the previous lineage. Yet, very little is known about the underlying modifications of the infection process that can explain this selective advantage. Here, we try to quantify how the Alpha variant differed from its predecessor on two phenotypic traits: the transmission rate and the duration of infectiousness. To this end, we analysed the joint epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics as a function of the Stringency Index, a measure of the amount of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions. Assuming that these control measures reduce contact rates and transmission, we developed a two-step approach based on SEIR models and the analysis of a combination of epidemiological and evolutionary information. First, we quantify the link between Stringency Index and the reduction in viral transmission. Secondly, based on a novel theoretical derivation of the selection gradient in an SEIR model, we infer the phenotype of the Alpha variant from its frequency changes. We show that its selective advantage is more likely to result from a higher transmission than from a longer infectious period.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by grants ANR-16-CE35-0012 "STEEP" to SL and ANR-17-CE35-0012 "EVOMALWILD" to SG from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche.

%X Both vector and mRNA vaccines were an important part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may be required in future outbreaks and pandemics. However, adenoviral vectored (AdV) vaccines may be less immunogenic than mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. We assessed anti-spike and anti-vector immunity among infection-naïve Health Care Workers (HCW) following two doses of AdV (AZD1222) versus mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine. 183 AdV and 274 mRNA vaccinees enrolled between April and October 2021. Median ages were 42 and 39 years, respectively. Blood was collected at least once, 10-48 days after vaccine dose 2. Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and spike binding antibody titres were a median of 4.2 and 2.2 times lower, respectively, for AdV compared to mRNA vaccinees (p&lt;0.001). Median percentages of memory B cells that recognized fluorescent-tagged spike and RBD were 2.9 and 8.3 times lower, respectively for AdV compared to mRNA vaccinees. Titres of IgG reactive with human Adenovirus type 5 hexon protein rose a median of 2.2-fold after AdV vaccination but were not correlated with anti-spike antibody titres. Together the results show that mRNA induced substantially more sVNT antibody than AdV vaccine due to greater B cell expansion and targeting of the RBD. Pre-existing AdV vector cross-reactive antibodies were boosted following AdV vaccination but had no detectable effect on immunogenicity.Key pointsmRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induced higher surrogate neutralizing antibody titres than adenoviral vaccinemRNA vaccine induced a more potent, RBD-targeted B cell response than AdV vaccineAdenoviral vaccine boosted antibodies against human Adenovirus, but titres don’t correlate with anti-spike titresCompeting Interest StatementAF reports research funding from Sanofi.

%X There are majorly two variants of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that were employed worldwide on emergency basis to contain the COVID-19 pandemic i.e., RNA based or adenovirus construct based Spike protein expression system which was broadly used and the inactivated virus particle composition. Due to emergency usage starting from the onset of 2021, the immunogenicity data pertaining to long term effects of these vaccines is unexplored. Therefore, in this study we assessed the immunogenicity analysis of Covaxin (BBV152), an inactivated virus-based vaccine for a longitudinal time-span of two years. We investigated the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in 250 subjects for two years by estimating the RBD specific IgG titres and CD4+/CD8+ T-cell responses. We found that anti-RBD IgG titres that were almost reaching at the basal levels within a year of 2nd dose of vaccination, went significantly high immediately after Omicron infection wave in January 2022. Moreover, the pseudo-virus neutralization by the serum of these subjects showed concordant and drastic increase in virus neutralization activity. At the same time, mild or no symptoms were observed in individuals infected with Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. These observations strongly suggested that Omicron variant could have been the best SARS-CoV-2 variant for effective vaccine formulations to generate robust protective immune response along with lesser side effects. Interestingly, the CD4+ and CD8+T-cell activity in Covaxin vaccinees depicted mild to moderate but sustained responses. The spike peptivator pool activated PBMCs of vaccinees depicted an enhancement of CD4+ and CD8+ antigenic responses after 2nd and 3rd dose of vaccine administration. In comparison to Covishield, the antibody and T-cell responses were found to be milder in BBV152 vaccinees. This milder antibody and T-cell response could be the reason behind no or less side effects with BBV152 administration than other RNA based vaccines. Overall, our study is one of the first studies profiling the longitudinal humoral and T-cell responses of inactivated virus-based vaccines like COVAXIN, which was predominantly used in India and neighbouring Southeast Asian countries.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by DBT, BIRAC (BT/CS0053/05/21) and ILS Core GrantAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of Institute of Life Sciences gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The emergence of a highly contagious novel coronavirus in 2019 led to an unprecedented need for large scale diagnostic testing. The associated challenges including reagent shortages, cost, deployment delays, and turnaround time have all highlighted the need for an alternative suite of low-cost tests. Here, we demonstrate a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA that provides direct detection of viral RNA and eliminates the need for costly enzymes. We employ DNA nanoswitches that respond to segments of the viral RNA by a change in shape that is readable by gel electrophoresis. A new multi-targeting approach samples 120 different viral regions to improve the limit of detection and provide robust detection of viral variants. We apply our approach to a cohort of clinical samples, positively identifying a subset of samples with high viral loads. Since our method directly detects multiple regions of viral RNA without amplification, it eliminates the risk of amplicon contamination and renders the method less susceptible to false positives. This new tool can benefit the COVID-19 pandemic and future emerging outbreaks, providing a third option between amplification-based RNA detection and protein antigen detection. Ultimately, we believe this tool can be adapted both for low-resource onsite testing as well as for monitoring viral loads in recovering patients.Competing Interest StatementK.H. and W.P.W were joint inventors of DNA nanoswitches and hold several patents on the core technology. A.R.C., L.Z., D.Y., and C.H. are also inventors on nanoswitch related patents.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Science Foundation under award CBET2030279 to K.H. and W.P.W. and by the National Institutes of Health through the National Institute of General Medical Sciences under award R35GM124720 to K.H. and R35GM119537 to W.P.W.

%X Objectives To assess the effectiveness of at least one-dose of the Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavaria Nordic (MVA-BN) smallpox vaccine, administered pre-exposure, against mpox virus (MPXV) infection in persons receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (HIV-PrEP).Design Retrospective cohort, constructed by deterministic linkage of electronic health records.Setting 15 of 19 regions in Spain (&gt;95% population), between July 12 and December 12, 2022Participants Men ≥18 years, receiving HIV-PrEP as of July 12 and with no previous MPXV infection or vaccination against mpox.Interventions On each day, we matched individuals receiving a first dose of MVA-BN vaccine pre-exposure and unvaccinated controls of the same age (±5 years) and region.Main outcome measures We estimated the risk of laboratory-confirmed infection with MPXV using a Kaplan-Meier estimator and calculated risk ratios (RR) and vaccine effectiveness (VE=1-RR).Results We included 5,660 matched pairs, with a median follow-up of 62 days (interquartile range 24-97). Mpox cumulative incidence was 5.6 per 1,000 (25 cases) in unvaccinated and 3.5 per 1,000 (18 cases) in vaccinated; last case occurred at 63 and 17 days after enrolment, respectively. No effect was found during days 0-6 post-vaccination (VE -38.3; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): -332.7; 46.4), but VE was 65% in ≥7 days (95%CI 22.9; 88.0) and 79% in ≥14 days (95%CI 33.3; 100.0) after vaccination.Conclusion At least one dose of MVA-BN vaccine offered protection against mpox in a most-at-risk population. Because the incidence of mpox was decreasing shortly after the vaccination campaign began, we can only assess its effectiveness shortly after vaccination. Further studies need to assess the VE of a second dose and the duration of protection over time.What is already known on this topic:MVA-BN vaccination is effective in producing an immune response against mpox virus (MPXV) and has shown clinical efficacy in animal models.During the current mpox outbreak, observational studies have indicated that MVA-BN vaccines are effective in preventing MPXV infection in real-life.No individual-based cohort study with proper implementation of causal inference methods, providing the highest quality of evidence with observational data, has been published to date.What this study adds:The administration of one dose of MVA-BN vaccine in a high-risk population (men receiving HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis) reduced the risk of MPXV infection by 65% starting 7 days after the administration and by 79% starting 14 days after.Effectiveness of MVA-BN vaccine was similar in population under 50 years, a group where childhood smallpox vaccination is rare in Spain.This is the first study to estimate MVA-BN vaccine effectiveness in one of the countries most affected by the mpox outbreak in 2022, with a design and methods providing high quality evidence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding was obtained for this studyAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Institute of Health Carlos III (approval no.

%X Background Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the spike of SARS-CoV-2 prevent severe COVID-19. Omicron subvariants BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 evade neutralization of therapeutic mAbs, leading to recommendations against their use. Yet, the antiviral activities of mAbs in treated patients remain ill-defined.Methods We investigated neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of D614G, BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 in 320 sera from 80 immunocompromised patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 prospectively treated with mAbs (sotrovimab, n=29; imdevimab/casirivimab, n=34; cilgavimab/tixagevimab, n=4) or anti-protease (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, n=13). We measured live-virus neutralization titers and quantified ADCC with a reporter assay.Findings Only Sotrovimab elicits serum neutralization and ADCC against BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5. As compared to D614G, sotrovimab neutralization titers of BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 are reduced (71- and 58-fold, respectively), but ADCC levels are only slightly decreased (1.4- and 1-fold, for BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5, respectively).Interpretation Our results show that sotrovimab is active against BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 in treated individuals, suggesting that it may be a valuable therapeutic option.Competing Interest StatementT.B. and O.S. have a pending patent application for an anti-RBD mAb not used in this study (PCT/FR2021/070522).

%X The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths globally, and while several diagnostic systems were proposed, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold standard. However, diagnostic reagents, including enzymes used in RT-PCR, are subject to centralized production models and intellectual property restrictions, which present a challenge for less developed countries. With the aim of generating a standardized One-Step open RT-qPCR protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples, we purified and tested recombinant enzymes and a non-proprietary buffer. The protocol utilized M-MLV RT and Taq DNA pol enzymes to perform a Taqman probe-based assay. Synthetic RNA samples were used to validate the One-Step RT-qPCR components, and the kit showed comparable sensitivity to approved commercial kits. The One-Step RT-qPCR was then tested on clinical samples and demonstrated similar performance to commercial kits in terms of positive and negative calls. This study represents a proof of concept for an open approach to developing diagnostic kits for viral infections and diseases, which could provide a cost-effective and accessible solution for less developed countries.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocols https://www.protocols.io/view/recombinant-protein-expression-and-purification-of-bzusp6we https://www.protocols.io/view/recombinant-expression-and-purification-of-codon-o-bsernbd6 https://www.protocols.io/view/recombinant-protein-expression-and-purification-of-bya3psgn Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) through the ANID Millennium Science Initiative Program (ICN17_022) to RAG, CARS and FF.

%T Within-host SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics informed by complex life course exposures reveals different intrinsic properties of Omicron and Delta variants

%X The emergence of successive SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) during 2020-22, each exhibiting increased epidemic growth relative to earlier circulating variants, has created a need to understand the drivers of such growth. However, both pathogen biology and changing host characteristics – such as varying levels of immunity – can combine to influence replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within and between hosts. Disentangling the role of variant and host in individual-level viral shedding of VOCs is essential to inform COVID-19 planning and response, and interpret past epidemic trends. Using data from a prospective observational cohort study of healthy adult volunteers undergoing weekly occupational health PCR screening, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct individual-level viral kinetics and estimate how different factors shaped viral dynamics, measured by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values over time. Jointly accounting for both inter-individual variation in Ct values and complex host characteristics – such as vaccination status, exposure history and age – we found that age and number of prior exposures had a strong influence on peak viral replication. Older individuals and those who had at least five prior antigen exposures to vaccination and/or infection typically had much lower levels of shedding. Moreover, we found evidence of a correlation between the speed of early shedding and duration of incubation period when comparing different VOCs and age groups. Our findings illustrate the value of linking information on participant characteristics, symptom profile and infecting variant with prospective PCR sampling, and the importance of accounting for increasingly complex population exposure landscapes when analysing the viral kinetics of VOCs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04750356Funding StatementTWR, LACC and AK were supported by funding from the Wellcome Trust (20650/Z/17/Z).

%X SARS-CoV-2 infection in children typically results in asymptomatic or mild disease. There is a paucity of studies on antiviral immunity in African children. We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in 71 unvaccinated asymptomatic South African children who were seropositive or seronegative for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses were detectable in 83% of seropositive and 60% of seronegative children. Although the magnitude of the CD4+ T cell response did not differ significantly between the two groups, their functional profiles were distinct, with SARS-CoV-2 seropositive children exhibiting a higher proportion of polyfunctional T cells compared to their seronegative counterparts. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in seronegative children was associated with the endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) HKU1 IgG response. Overall, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-responding T cells in seronegative children may result from cross-reactivity to endemic coronaviruses and could contribute to the relative protection from disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected children.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by the South African Medical Research Council (SA-MRC) with funds received from the South African Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), (grants 96825, SHIPNCD 76756, and DST/CON 0250/2012), the Poliomyelitis Research Foundation (21/65) and the Wellcome Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa (CIDRI-Africa), which is supported by core funding from the Wellcome Trust (203135/Z/16/Z and 222754).

%X Virus concentrations measured in municipal wastewater help inform both the water treatment necessary to protect human health and wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater measurements are typically PCR-based, and interpreting gene copy concentrations requires an understanding of the form and stability of the nucleic acids. Here, we study the persistence of model virus genomes in wastewater, the protective effects provided by the virus capsids, and the relative decay rates of genome and infectious viruses. In benchtop batch experiments at 25 °C, extraviral (+)ssRNA and dsDNA amplicons degraded by 90% within 15-19 minutes and 1.6-1.9 hours, respectively. When encapsidated, the T90 for MS2 (+)ssRNA increased by 424× and the T90 for T4 dsDNA increased by 52×. The (+)ssRNA decay rates were similar for a range of amplicon sizes. For our model phages MS2 and T4, the nucleic acid signal in untreated wastewater disappeared shortly after the viruses lost infectivity. Combined, these results suggest that most viral genome copies measured in wastewater are part of intact virus particles, that measured concentrations are independent of assay amplicon sizes, and that the virus genome decay rates of naked viruses are similar to inactivation rates. These findings will be valuable for the interpretation of wastewater virus measurements.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Science Foundation through a Graduate Research Fellowship.

%X Background The natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission dynamics may have changed as SARS-CoV-2 has evolved and population immunity has shifted.Methods Household contacts, enrolled from two multi-site case-ascertained household transmission studies (April 2020–April 2021 and September 2021–September 2022), were followed for 10–14 days after enrollment with daily collection of nasal swabs and/or saliva for SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptom diaries. SARS-CoV-2 virus lineage was determined by whole genome sequencing, with multiple imputation where sequences could not be recovered. Adjusted infection risks were estimated using modified Poisson regression.Findings 858 primary cases with 1473 household contacts were examined. Among unvaccinated household contacts, the infection risk adjusted for presence of prior infection and age was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49–68%) in households currently exposed to pre-Delta lineages and 90% (95% CI: 74–100%) among those exposed to Omicron BA.5 (detected May – September 2022). The fraction of infected household contacts reporting any symptom was similarly high between pre-Delta (86%, 95% CI: 81–91%) and Omicron lineages (77%, 70–85%). Among Omicron BA.5-infected contacts, 48% (41–56%) reported fever, 63% (56–71%) cough, 22% (17–28%) shortness of breath, and 20% (15–27%) loss of/change in taste/smell.Interpretation The risk of infection among household contacts exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is high and increasing with more recent SARS-CoV-2 lineages. This high infection risk highlights the importance of vaccination to prevent severe disease.Funding Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.Key points- Monitoring the transmissibility and symptomatology of SARS-CoV-2 lineages is important for informing public health practice and understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19; household transmission studies contribute to our understanding of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants.- The Omicron BA.5 sub-lineage is highly transmissible, similar to previous Omicron sub-lineages.- Over 80% of infected household contacts reported at least 1 symptom during their infection and the proportion of household contacts with asymptomatic infection did not differ by SARS-CoV-2 variant. The most common symptom was cough. Change in taste or smell was more common in Omicron BA.5 infections, compared to previous Omicron sub-lineages, but less common compared to pre-Delta lineages.- The high infection risk among household contacts supports the recommendations that individuals maintain up-to-date and lineage-specific vaccinations to mitigate further risks of severe disease.Competing Interest StatementASL discloses personal fees to Sanofi and Roche outside the submitted work.

%X Background After the first COVID-19 wave caused by the ancestral lineage, the pandemic has been fueled from the continuous emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Understanding key time-to-event periods for each emerging variant of concern is critical as it can provide insights into the future trajectory of the virus and help inform outbreak preparedness and response planning. Here, we aim to examine how the incubation period, serial interval, and generation time have changed from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 lineage to different variants of concern.Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that synthesized the estimates of incubation period, serial interval, and generation time (both realized and intrinsic) for the ancestral lineage, Alpha, Beta, and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2.Results Our study included 274 records obtained from 147 household studies, contact tracing studies or studies where epidemiological links were known. With each emerging variant, we found a progressive shortening of each of the analyzed key time-to-event periods. Specifically, we found that Omicron had the shortest pooled estimates for the incubation period (3.63 days, 95%CI: 3.25-4.02 days), serial interval (3.19 days, 95%CI: 2.95-3.43 days), and realized generation time (2.96 days, 95%CI: 2.54-3.38 days) whereas the ancestral lineage had the highest pooled estimates for each of them. We also observed shorter pooled estimates for the serial interval compared to the incubation period across the virus lineages. We found considerable heterogeneities (I2 &gt; 80%) when pooling the estimates across different virus lineages, indicating potential unmeasured confounding from population factors (e.g., social behavior, deployed interventions).Conclusion Our study supports the importance of conducting contact tracing and epidemiological investigations to monitor changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. Our findings highlight a progressive shortening of the incubation period, serial interval, and generation time, which can lead to epidemics that spread faster, with larger peak incidence, and harder to control. We also consistently found a shorter serial interval than incubation period, suggesting that a key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is the potential for pre-symptomatic transmission. These observations are instrumental to plan for future COVID-19 waves.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by grants from the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82130093), Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (HS2021SHZX001), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) (NU38OT000297).

%X COVID-19 has infected humans worldwide, causing millions of deaths or prolonged symptoms in survivors. The transient or persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been defined as post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). We conducted a study of 151 Brazilian PCC patients to analyze symptoms and immunoglobulin profiles, taking into account gender, vaccination, hospitalization and age. Fatigue and myalgia were the most common symptoms and lack of vaccination, hospitalization, and neuropsychiatric and metabolic comorbidities were relevant for the development of PCC. Analysis of serological immunoglobulins showed that IgA was higher in PCC patients, especially in the adult and elderly groups. Also, non-hospitalized and hospitalized PCC patients produced high and similar levels of IgA. Our results indicated that the detection of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 during the course of the disease could be associated with the development of PCC and may be an immunological signature to predict prolonged symptoms in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by the Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), through grant numbers E-26/210.822/2021 and E-26/201.005/2022, and by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Comite de etica em Pesquisa UFRJ-Macae; CAAE protocol: 57373422.8.0000.5699I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X China experienced a major nationwide wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in December 2022, immediately after lifting strict interventions, despite the majority of the population having already received inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. Due to the rapid waning of protection and the emergence of Omicron XBB.1.5, the risk of another COVID-19 wave remains high. It is still unclear whether the health care system will be able to manage the demand during this potential XBB.1.5 wave and if the number of associated deaths can be reduced to a level comparable to that of seasonal influenza. Thus, we developed a mathematical model of XBB.1.5 transmission using Shanghai as a case study. We found that a potential XBB.1.5 wave is less likely to overwhelm the health care system and would result in a death toll comparable to that of seasonal influenza, albeit still larger, especially among elderly individuals. Our analyses show that a combination of vaccines and antiviral drugs can effectively mitigate an XBB.1.5 epidemic, with a projected number of deaths of 2.08 per 10,000 individuals.This figure corresponds to a 70–80% decrease compared to the previous Omicron wave and is comparable to the level of seasonal influenza. The peak prevalence of hospital admissions and ICU admissions are projected at 28.89 and 2.28 per 10,000 individuals, respectively, suggesting the need for a moderate increase in the capacity of the health care system. Our findings emphasize the importance of improving vaccination coverage, particularly among the older population, and the use of antiviral treatments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was supported by grants from the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82130093), and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (grant no. 16/137/109) using UK aid from the UK Government to support global health research.

%X Correctional facilities are high-priority settings for coordinated public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. These facilities are at high risk of disease transmission due to close contacts between people in prison and with the wider community. People in prison are also vulnerable to severe disease given their high burden of co-morbidities. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the effect of various public health interventions, including vaccination, on the mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks, applying it to prisons in Australia and Canada. We found that, in the absence of any intervention, an outbreak would occur and infect almost 100% of people in prison within 20 days of the index case. However, the rapid rollout of vaccines with other non-pharmaceutical interventions would almost eliminate the risk of an outbreak. Our study highlights that high vaccination coverage is required for variants with high transmission probability to completely mitigate the outbreak risk in prisons.Article Summary Line High vaccination coverage is required to eliminate the risk of an outbreak in prisonsCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Corrective Services NSW.

%X Background Regulatory approval of new over-the-counter tests for infectious agents such as SARS-CoV-2 has historically required that clinical trials include diverse groups of specific patient populations, making the approval process slow and expensive. Showing that populations do not differ in their viral loads—the key factor determining test performance—could expedite the evaluation of new tests.Methods 46,726 RT-qPCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were annotated with patient demographics and health status. Real-world performance of two commercially available antigen tests was evaluated over a wide range of viral loads. An open-access web portal was created allowing comparisons of viral-load distributions across patient groups and application of antigen-test performance characteristics to patient distributions to predict antigen-test performance on these groups.Findings In several cases distributions were surprisingly similar where a difference was expected (e.g. smokers vs. non-smokers); in other cases there was a difference that was the opposite direction from expectations (e.g. higher in patients who identified as White vs. Black). Sensitivity and specificity of antigen tests for detecting contagiousness were similar across most groups. The portal is at https://arnaoutlab.org/coviral/.Conclusions In silico analyses of large-scale, real-world clinical data repositories can serve as a timely evidence-based proxy for dedicated trials of antigen tests for specific populations. Free availability of richly annotated data facilitates large-scale hypothesis generation and testing.Funding Funded by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA (RA and JEK) and via a Novel Therapeutics Delivery Grant from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center (JEK).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunded by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA and via a Novel Therapeutics Delivery Grant from the Massachusetts Life Sciences CenterAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Ethics committee/IRB of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Since emergence of the initial SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5 variants, omicron has diversified substantially. Antigenic characterization of these new variants is important to analyze their potential immune escape from population immunity and implications for future vaccine composition. Here, we describe an antigenic map based on human single-exposure sera and live-virus isolates that includes a broad selection of recently emerged omicron variants such as BA.2.75, BF.7, BQ, XBB and XBF variants. Recent omicron variants clustered around BA.1 and BA.5 with some variants further extending the antigenic space. Based on this antigenic map we constructed antibody landscapes to describe neutralization profiles after booster immunization with bivalent mRNA vaccines based on ancestral virus and either BA.1 or BA.4/5 omicron. Immune escape of BA.2.75, BQ, XBB and XBF variants was also evident in bivalently boosted individuals, however, cross-neutralization was improved for those with hybrid immunity. Our results indicate that future vaccine updates are needed to induce cross-neutralizing antibodies against currently circulating variants.Competing Interest StatementDB declares to hold stocks of Pfizer and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

%X Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are key organizers of tissue immune responses and regulate tissue development, repair, and pathology. Persistent clinical sequelae beyond 12 weeks following acute COVID-19 disease, named post-COVID syndrome (PCS), are increasingly recognized in convalescent individuals. ILCs have been associated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms but their role in the development of PCS remains poorly defined. Here we used multiparametric immune phenotyping, finding expanded circulating ILC precursors (ILCPs) and concurrent decreased group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in PCS patients compared to well-matched convalescent control groups at &gt; 3 months after infection. Patients with PCS showed elevated expression of chemokines and cytokines associated with trafficking of immune cells (CCL19/MIP-3b, FLT3-ligand), endothelial inflammation and repair (CXCL1, EGF, RANTES, IL1RA, PDGF-AA). These results define immunological parameters associated with PCS and might help find biomarkers and disease-relevant therapeutic strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe Post-COVID LMU research project is financially supported by the Bavarian State Ministry for Health and Care and the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL).

%X Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance has been used worldwide to provide valuable public health data. RT-qPCR is frequently used as a quantitative methodology for wastewater surveillance but is susceptible to mutations in target regions. These mutations may lead to misinterpretation of surveillance data; a drop in signal could be concluded to be a result of lower viral load, when in fact it is caused by reduced detection efficiency. We describe a novel approach to mitigating the impacts of such mutations: monitoring the cumulative signal from two targets (N1 and N2) via independent amplification reactions using identically labeled probes; a “single-channel multiplex” approach. Using the IDEXX Water SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test, we demonstrate equivalent intra-assay repeatability and quantitative results from the combined N1N2 test when compared to individual N1 and N2 assays. Furthermore, we show that while mutations in B.1.1.529, BA.5.2, and BA.5.2.1 significantly impact the performance of the N1 assay, the impact on the N1N2 assay was negligible, and nearly within acceptable margin of error for technical replicates. These findings demonstrate that a single-channel multiplex approach can be used to improve the robustness of wastewater surveillance and minimize the risk of future mutations leading to unreliable public health data.Competing Interest StatementBoth Brian Swalla and Amy Pednault are employed by IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.Funding StatementThis study was funded by IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The effective reproductive number Rt has taken a central role in the scientific, political, and public discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous real-time estimates of this quantity routinely published. Disagreement between estimates can be substantial and may lead to confusion among decision-makers and the general public. In this work, we compare different estimates of the national-level effective reproductive number of COVID-19 in Germany in 2020 and 2021. We consider the agreement between estimates from the same method but published at different time points (within-method agreement) as well as retrospective agreement across different approaches (between-method agreement). Concerning the former, estimates from some methods are very stable over time and hardly subject to revisions, while others display considerable fluctuations. To evaluate between-method agreement, we reproduce the estimates generated by different groups using a variety of statistical approaches, standardizing analytical choices to assess how they contribute to the observed disagreement. These analytical choices include the data source, data pre-processing, assumed generation time distribution, statistical tuning parameters, and various delay distributions. We find that in practice, these auxiliary choices in the estimation of Rt may affect results at least as strongly as the selection of the statistical approach. They should thus be communicated transparently along with the estimates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJohannes Bracher was supported by the Helmholtz Foundation via the project SIMCARD.

%X We report SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in sera of triple-vaccinated individuals who received a booster dose of an original monovalent or a bivalent BA.1- or BA.4/BA.5-adapted vaccine, or had a breakthrough infection with Omicron variants BA.1, BA.2 or BA.4/BA.5. A bivalent BA.4/BA.5 booster or Omicron-breakthrough infection induced increased Omicron-neutralization titers compared with the monovalent booster.

%X Contact tracing forms a crucial part of the public-health toolbox in mitigating and understanding emergent pathogens and nascent disease outbreaks. Contact tracing in the United States was conducted during the pre-Omicron phase of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This tracing relied on voluntary reporting and responses, often using rapid antigen tests (with a high false negative rate) due to lack of accessibility to PCR tests. These limitations, combined with SARS-CoV-2’s propensity for asymptomatic transmission, raise the question “how reliable was contact tracing for COVID-19 in the United States”? We answered this question using a Markov model to examine the efficiency with which transmission could be detected based on the design and response rates of contact tracing studies in the United States. Our results suggest that contact tracing protocols in the U.S. are unlikely to have identified more than 1.65% (95% uncertainty interval: 1.62%-1.68%) of transmission events with PCR testing and 0.88% (95% uncertainty interval 0.86%-0.89%) with rapid antigen testing. When considering an optimal scenario, based on compliance rates in East Asia with PCR testing, this increases to 62.7% (95% uncertainty interval: 62.6%-62.8%). These findings highlight the limitations in interpretability for studies of SARS-CoV-2 disease spread based on U.S. contact tracing and underscore the vulnerability of the population to future disease outbreaks, for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNational Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, award number: R35GM141821Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The question if the bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccination, containing wild type and BA.5 spike, provides enhanced benefits against BA.5 and similar Omicron subvariants has been widely debated. One concern was an ‘original antigenic sin’-like effect which may redirect immune responses to the bivalent vaccine towards the wild type spike and may block de novo generation of BA.5 specific antibodies. Here, we characterized the response to the bivalent vaccine and we performed antibody depletion experiments. Interestingly, when we depleted serum of all antibodies to wild type RBD, we also removed all reactivity to BA.5 RBD. This suggests that all antibodies induced by the bivalent vaccine – at least with the limit of detection of our assay in polyclonal serum - are in fact cross-reactive. This further suggests that, on a serum antibody level, the bivalent vaccine did not induce a de novo response to BA.5.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%X The dynamics of epidemiological phenomena associated to infectious diseases have long been modelled with different approaches. However, recent pandemic events exposed many areas of opportunity to improve over the existing models. We develop a model based on the idea that transitions between epidemiological stages are alike sampling processes. Such processes may involve more than one subset of the population or they may be mostly dependent on time intervals defined by infectious or clinical criteria. We apply the model to simulate epidemics and obtain realistic case fatality ratios. We also analyse the impact of the proportion of asymptomatic of infected people in the distribution of the total infected population and define a basic reproductive number, which determines the existence of a probabilistic phase transition for the pandemics dynamics. The resulting modelling scheme is robust, easy to implement, and can readily lend itself for extensions aimed at answering questions that emerge from close examination of data trends, such as those emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, and other infectious diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementDGAPA- PAPIIT-UNAM grant IN-228820, MAHV DGAPA- PAPIIT-UNAM grant IN-102822, SILAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, research has shown that adult patients mount broad and durable immune responses to infection. However, response to infection remains poorly studied in infants/young children. In this study, we evaluated humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 23 infants/young children before and after infection. We found that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens peaked approximately 30 days after infection and were maintained up to 500 days with little apparent decay. While the magnitude of humoral responses was similar to an adult cohort recovered from mild/moderate COVID-19, both binding and neutralization titers to WT SARS-CoV-2 were more durable in infants/young children, with Spike and RBD IgG antibody half-life nearly 4X as long as in adults. The functional breadth of adult and infant/young children SARS-CoV-2 responses were comparable, with similar reactivity against panel of recent and previously circulating viral variants. Notably, IgG subtype analysis revealed that while IgG1 formed the majority of both adults’ and infants/young children’s response, IgG3 was more common in adults and IgG2 in infants/young children. These findings raise important questions regarding differential regulation of humoral immunity in infants/young children and adults and could have broad implications for the timing of vaccination and booster strategies in this age group.Competing Interest StatementMSS has served as an advisor for Ocugen and Moderna.

%X COVID-19 affects the population unequally with a higher impact on aged and immunosuppressed people. Hence, we assessed the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in immune compromised patients (older adults and oncohematologic patients), compared with healthy counterparts. While the acquired humoral and cellular memory did not predict subsequent infection 18 months after full immunization, spectral and computational cytometry revealed several subsets within the CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, monocytes and CD45RA+CCR7- Tγδ cells differentially expressed in further infected and non-infected individuals not just following immunization, but also prior to that. Of note, up to 7 subsets were found within the CD45RA+CCR7- Tγδ population with some of them being expanded and other decreased in subsequently infected individuals. Moreover, some of these subsets also predicted COVID-induced hospitalization in oncohematologic patients. Therefore, we hereby have identified several cellular subsets that, even before vaccination, strongly related to COVID-19 vulnerability as opposed to the acquisition of cellular and/or humoral memory following vaccination with SARS-CoV- 2 mRNA vaccines.SUMMARY An in depth and unbiased spectral cytometry characterization of the immune system before and after COVID-19 vaccination can predict not just subsequent PCR-confirmed infection, but also COVID-induced hospitalization in immune compromised patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study has been funded through Programa Estrategico Instituto de Biologia y Genetica Molecular (IBGM Junta de Castilla y Leon.

%X Earlier global detection of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants gives governments more time to respond. However, few countries can implement timely national surveillance resulting in gaps in monitoring. The UK implemented large-scale community and hospital surveillance, but experience suggests it may be faster to detect new variants through testing UK arrivals for surveillance. We developed simulations of the emergence and importation of novel variants with a range of infection hospitalisation rates (IHR) to the UK. We compared time taken to detect the variant though testing arrivals at UK borders, hospital admissions, and the general community. We found that sampling 10-50% of arrivals at UK borders could confer a speed advantage of 3.5-6 weeks over existing community surveillance, and 1.5–5 weeks (depending on IHR) over hospital testing. We conclude that directing limited global capacity for surveillance to highly connected ports could speed up global detection of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding was provided for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Strategies to improve the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines are necessary to optimise their protection against disease. Fractional dosing by intradermal administration (ID) has been shown to be equally immunogenic as intramuscular (IM) for several vaccines, but the immunogenicity of ID inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 at the full dose is unknown. This study (NCT04800133) investigated the superiority of antibody and T cell responses of full-dose CoronaVac by ID over IM in adolescents. Participants aged 11-17 years received 2 doses IM or ID, followed by the 3rd dose 13-42 days later. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity outcomes were measured post-dose 2 (IM-CC versus ID-CC) and post-dose 3 (IM-CCC versus ID-CCC). Doses 2 and 3 were administered to 173 and 104 adolescents, respectively. S IgG, S-RBD IgG, S IgG FcγRIIIa-binding, SNM-specific IL-2+CD4+, SNM-specific IL-2+CD8+, S-specific IL-2+CD8+, N-specific IL-2+CD4+, N-specific IL-2+CD8+ and M-specific IL-2+CD4+ responses fulfilled the superior and non-inferior criteria for ID-CC compared to IM-CC, whereas IgG avidity was inferior. For ID-CCC, S-RBD IgG, surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT), 90% plaque reduction neutralisation titre (PRNT90), PRNT50, S IgG avidity, S IgG FcγRIIIa-binding, M-specific IL-2+CD4+, interferon-γ+CD8+ and IL-2+CD8+ responses were superior and non-inferior to IM-CCC. The estimated vaccine efficacies were 49%, 52%, 66% and 79% for IM-CC, ID-CC, IM-CCC and ID-CCC, respectively. More in the ID groups reported local, mild adverse reactions. This is the first study to demonstrate superior antibody and M-specific T cell responses by ID inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and serves as the basis for future research to improve immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines.Competing Interest StatementJ.S.

%X Individuals with weaker neutralizing responses show reduced protection with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Booster vaccines are recommended for vaccinated individuals, but the uptake is low. We present the feasibility of utilizing point-of-care tests (POCT) to support evidence-based decision-making around COVID-19 booster vaccinations. Using infectious virus neutralization, ACE2 blocking, spike binding, and TCR sequencing assays, we investigated the dynamics of changes in the breadth and depth of blood and salivary antibodies as well as T-cell clonal response following mRNA vaccination in a cohort of healthcare providers. We evaluated the accuracy of two POCTs utilizing either blood or saliva to identify those in whom humoral immunity was inadequate. &gt;4 months after two doses of mRNA vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing Abs (nAbs) and T-cell clones declined 40-80%, and 2/3rd lacked Omicron nAbs. After the third mRNA booster, binding and neutralizing Abs increased overall in the systemic compartment; notably, individuals with previously weak nAbs gained sharply. The third dose failed to stimulate secretory IgA, but salivary IgG closely tracked systemic IgG levels. Vaccine boosting increased Ab breadth against a divergent bat sarbecovirus, SHC014, although the TCR-beta sequence breadth was unchanged. Post 3rd booster dose, Ab avidity increased for the Wuhan and Delta strains, while avidity against Omicron and SHC014 increased to levels seen for Wuhan after the second dose. Negative results on POCTs strongly correlated with a lack of functional humoral immunity. The third booster dose helps vaccinees gain depth and breadth of systemic Abs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. Our findings show that POCTs are useful and easy-to-access tools to inform inadequate humoral immunity accurately. POCTs designed to match the circulating variants can help individuals with booster vaccine decisions and could serve as a population-level screening platform to preserve herd immunity.One Sentence Summary SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antibody tests are valuable and easy-to-access tools to inform inadequate humoral immunity and to support informed decision-making regarding the current and future booster vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the NCI Serological Sciences Network (4U54CA260543 to RSB and LP; U01CA260469 to CDH; U01CA260541 and U01CA260541-02S1 to AMD and JDB).

%X Disease spread can be affected by pharmaceutical (such as vaccination) and non-pharmaceutical interventions (such as physical distancing, mask-wearing, and contact tracing). Understanding the relationship between disease dynamics and human behavior is a significant factor to controlling infections. In this work, we propose a compartmental epidemiological model for studying how the infection dynamics of COVID-19 evolves for people with different levels of social distancing, natural immunity, and vaccine-induced immunity. Our model recreates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Ontario up to December 2021. Our results indicate that people change their behaviour based on the disease dynamics and mitigation measures. Specifically, they adapt more protective behaviour when the number of infections is high and social distancing measures are in effect, and they recommence their activities when vaccination coverage is high and relaxation measures are introduced. We demonstrate that waning of infection and vaccine-induced immunity are important for reproducing disease transmission in Fall 2021.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by NSERC (JMH, IM), CIHR (JMH), and the OMNI-REUNI NSERC-PHAC Emerging Infectious Disease Modelling Initiative (JMH, IM).

%X Background The associations between longitudinal dynamics and the breadth of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response with various Long COVID (LC) phenotypes prior to vaccination are not known. The capacity of antibodies to cross neutralize a variety of viral variants may be associated with ongoing pathology and persistent symptoms.Methods We measured longitudinal neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibody responses to pre- and post-SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in participants infected during the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, prior to wide-spread rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Cross sectional regression models adjusted for various clinical covariates and longitudinal mixed effects models were used to determine the impact of the breadth and rate of decay of neutralizing responses on the development of Long COVID symptoms in general, as well as LC phenotypes.Results We identified several novel relationships between SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization and the presence of LC symptoms. Specifically, we show that, although neutralizing antibody responses to the original, infecting strain of SARS-CoV-2 were not associated with LC in cross-sectional analyses, cross-neutralization ID50 levels to the Omicron BA.5 variant approximately 4 months following acute infection was independently and significantly associated with greater odds of LC and with persistent gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Longitudinal modeling demonstrated significant associations in the overall levels and rates of decay of neutralization capacity with LC phenotypes. A higher proportion of participants had antibodies capable of neutralizing Omicron BA.5 compared with BA.1 or XBB.1.5 variants.Conclusions Our findings suggest that relationships between various immune responses and LC are likely complex but may involve the breadth of antibody neutralization responses.Summary SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody neutralization of Omicron BA.5 variant approximately 4 months following acute infection with wild-type virus prior to vaccination was independently and significantly associated with greater odds of distinct Long COVID phenotypes.Competing Interest StatementMJP reports consulting fees for Gilead Sciences and AstraZeneca, outside the submitted work.

%X Understanding mucosal antibody responses from SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination is crucial to develop strategies for longer term immunity, especially against emerging viral variants. We profiled serial paired mucosal and plasma antibodies from: COVID-19 vaccinated only vaccinees (vaccinated, uninfected), COVID-19 recovered vaccinees (convalescent, vaccinated) and individuals with breakthrough Delta or Omicron BA.2 infections (vaccinated, infected). Saliva from COVID-19 recovered vaccinees displayed improved antibody neutralizing activity, FcγR engagement and IgA compared to COVID-19 uninfected vaccinees. Furthermore, repeated mRNA vaccination boosted SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG2 and IgG4 responses in both mucosa biofluids (saliva and tears) and plasma. IgG, but not IgA, responses to breakthrough COVID-19 variants were dampened and narrowed by increased pre-existing vaccine-induced immunity to the ancestral strain. Salivary antibodies delayed initiation of boosting following breakthrough COVID-19 infection, especially Omicron BA.2, however, rose rapidly thereafter. Our data highlight how pre-existing immunity shapes mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses and has implications for long-term protection from COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) GNT #2005544 to JAJ, SJK, AWC and GNT #2016062 to JAJ, MPD, SJK, AWC.

%X Anosmia is common with respiratory virus infections, but loss of taste or chemesthesis is rare. Reports of true taste loss with COVID-19 were viewed skeptically until confirmed by multiple studies. Nasal menthol thresholds are elevated in some with prior COVID-19 infections, but data on oral chemesthesis are lacking. Many patients recover quickly, but precise timing and synchrony of recovery are unclear. Here, we collected broad sensory measures over 28 days, recruiting adults (18-45 years) who were COVID-19 positive or recently exposed (close contacts per U.S. CDC criteria at the time of the study) in the first half of 2021. Participants received nose clips, red commercial jellybeans (Sour Cherry and Cinnamon), and scratch-n-sniff cards (ScentCheckPro). Among COVID-19 cases who entered the study on or before Day 10 of infection, Gaussian Process Regression showed odor identification and odor intensity (two distinct measures of function) each declined relative to controls (close contacts who never developed COVID-19), but effects were larger for intensity than identification. To assess changes during early onset, we identified four COVID-19 cases who enrolled on or prior to Day 1 of their illness – this allowed for visualization of baseline ratings, loss, and recovery of function over time. Four controls were matched for age, gender, and race. Variables included sourness and sweetness (Sour Cherry jellybeans), oral burn (Cinnamon jellybeans), mean orthonasal intensity of four odors (ScentCheckPro), and perceived nasal blockage. Data were plotted over 28 days, creating panel plots for the eight cases and controls. Controls exhibited stable ratings over time. By contrast, COVID-19 cases showed sharp deviations over time. No single pattern of taste loss or recovery was apparent, implying different taste qualities might recover at different rates. Oral burn was transiently reduced for some before recovering quickly, suggesting acute loss may be missed in data collected after acute illness ends. Changes in odor intensity or odor identification were not explained by nasal blockage. Collectively, intensive daily testing shows orthonasal smell, oral chemesthesis and taste were each altered by acute COVID-19 infection, and this disruption was dyssynchronous for different modalities, with variable loss and recovery rates across modalities and individuals.Competing Interest StatementDrs.

%X The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the first major multi-continental sporting Mass Gathering Event (MGE) of the post COVID-19 era to allow foreign spectators. Such large-scale MGEs can potentially lead to outbreaks of infectious disease and contribute to the global dissemination of such pathogens. Here we adapt previous work and create a generalisable model framework for assessing the use of disease control strategies at such events, in terms of reducing infections and hospitalisations. This framework utilises a combination of meta-populations based on clusters of people and their vaccination status, Ordinary Differential Equation integration between fixed time events, and Latin Hypercube sampling. We use the FIFA 2022 World Cup as a case study for this framework. Pre-travel screenings of visitors were found to have little effect in reducing COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations. With pre-match screenings of spectators and match staff being more effective. Rapid Antigen (RA) screenings 0.5 days before match day outperformed RT-PCR screenings 1.5 days before match day. A combination of pre-travel RT-PCR and pre-match RA testing proved to be the most successful screening-based regime. However, a policy of ensuring that all visitors had a COVID-19 vaccination (second or booster dose) within a few months before departure proved to be much more efficacious. The State of Qatar abandoned all COVID-19 related travel testing and vaccination requirements over the period of the World Cup. Our work suggests that the State of Qatar may have been correct in abandoning the pre-travel testing of visitors. However, there was a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations within Qatar over the World Cup. The research outlined here suggests a policy requiring visitors to have had a recent COVID-19 vaccination may have prevented the increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations during the world cup.Author summary Mass Gathering Events (MGEs) can potentially lead to outbreaks of infectious disease and facilitate the dissemination of such pathogens.

%X Inadequate immune response to vaccination is a long-standing problem faced by immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), requiring novel strategies to improve vaccine efficacy. In this study, the potential of mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) to improve T cell responses to COVID-19 vaccination was investigated. Following primary vaccination with adenoviral (ChAdOx1) or mRNA (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines, KTRs receiving rapamycin demonstrated T cell responses greater than those of healthy individuals, characterized by increased frequencies of vaccine-specific central memory, effector memory and TEMRA T cells, in both the CD4+ and CD8+ compartments. Relative to standard-of-care triple therapy, mTORi-based therapy was associated with a 12-fold greater functional T cell response to primary vaccination of KTRs. The use of rapamycin to augment T cell responses to COVID-19 booster (third dose) vaccination was next investigated in a randomized, controlled trial. Immunosuppression modification with rapamycin was feasible and well-tolerated, but did not improve vaccine-specific T cell responses in this cohort. To understand the parameters for effective use of rapamycin as a vaccine adjuvant, mice were treated with rapamycin before primary or booster vaccination with ancestral and/or Omicron COVID-19 vaccines. Supporting the findings from KTRs, significant enhancement of functional and stem-like memory T cell responses was observed when rapamycin was administered from the time of primary, rather than booster, vaccination. Collectively, a positive effect of mTOR inhibitors on vaccine-induced T cell immunity against COVID-19 in humans was demonstrated.One Sentence Summary Rapamycin use at the time of primary COVID-19 vaccination augments the formation of functional, vaccine-specific T cell memory in immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients.Competing Interest StatementAlessandro Sette is a consultant for Gritstone Bio, Flow Pharma, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Qiagen, Fortress, Gilead, Sanofi, Merck, RiverVest, MedaCorp, Turnstone, NA Vaccine Institute, Emervax, Gerson Lehrman Group and Guggenheim.

%X Certain behavioral practices such as wearing surgical masks, observing social distancing, and accepting vaccines impede the spread of COVID-19 and contain the severity of symptoms in the infected individuals. Opinions regarding whether to observe such behavioral practices evolve over time through interactions via networks that overlap with but are not identical to the physical interaction networks over which the disease progresses. This necessitates the joint study of COVID-19 evolution and opinion dynamics. We develop a mathematical model that can be easily adapted to a wide range of behavioral practices and captures in a computationally tractable manner the joint evolution of the disease and relevant opinions in populations of large sizes. Populations of large sizes are typically heterogeneous in that they comprise individuals of different age groups, genders, races, and underlying health conditions. Such groups have different propensities to imbibe severe forms of the disease, different physical contact, and social interaction patterns and rates. These lead to different disease and opinion dynamics in them. Our model is able to capture such diversities. Computations using our model reveal that opinion dynamics have a strong impact on fatality and hospitalization counts and the number of man-days lost due to symptoms both in the regular form of the disease and the extended forms, more commonly known as long COVID. We show that opinion dynamics in certain groups have a disproportionate impact on the overall public health attributes because they have high physical interaction rates, even when they have the lowest propensity to imbibe severe forms of the disease. This identifies a social vulnerability that mal-actors can utilize to inflict heavy public health damages through opinion campaigns targeting specific segments. Once such vulnerabilities are identified, which we accomplish, adequate precautions may be designed to enhance resilience to such targeted attacks and better protect public health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:N/AI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In the era of living with COVID-19, the risk of localised SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks remains. Here, we develop a multi-scale modelling framework for estimating the local outbreak risk for a viral disease (the probability that a major outbreak results from a single case introduced into the population), accounting for within-host viral dynamics. Compared to population-level models previously used to estimate outbreak risks, our approach enables more detailed analysis of how the risk can be mitigated through pre-emptive interventions such as antigen testing. Considering SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we quantify the within-host dynamics using data from individuals with omicron variant infections. We demonstrate that regular antigen testing reduces, but may not eliminate, the outbreak risk, depending on characteristics of local transmission. In our baseline analysis, daily antigen testing reduces the outbreak risk by 45% compared to a scenario without antigen testing. Additionally, we show that accounting for heterogeneity in within-host dynamics between individuals affects outbreak risk estimates and assessments of the impact of antigen testing. Our results therefore highlight important factors to consider when using multi-scale models to design pre-emptive interventions against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementW.S.H. acknowledges funding by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council via a Doctoral Prize (grant number EP/W524311/1) and by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science via an International Research Fellowship (short-term Predoctoral Fellowship).

%X Mucosal antibodies play a key role in the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract, and potentially in limiting virus replication and therefore onward transmission. While systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is well understood, little is known about the antibodies present on the nasal mucosal surfaces.In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 mucosal antibodies in response to infection, vaccination, or a combination of both. Paired nasal fluid and serum samples were collected from 136 individuals, which include convalescent, vaccinated, or breakthrough infections.We detected a high correlation between IgG responses in serum and nasal fluids, which were higher in both compartments in vaccinated compared to convalescent participants. Contrary, nasal and systemic SARS-CoV-2 IgA responses were weakly correlated, indicating a compartmentalization between the local and systemic IgA responses. SARS-CoV-2 secretory component IgA (s-IgA) antibodies, present exclusively on mucosal surfaces, were detected in the nasal fluid only in a minority of vaccinated subjects and were significantly higher in previously infected individuals. s-IgA binding antibodies showed significant correlation with neutralizing activity of nasal fluids against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral B.1 and Omicron-BA.5 variant, indicating that s-IgA is the crucial contributor to neutralization in the nasal mucosa. Neutralization against both SARS-CoV-2 strains was higher in the mucosa of subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to vaccinated participants.In summary, we demonstrate that currently available vaccines elicit strong systemic antibody responses, but SARS-CoV-2 infection generates more potent binding and neutralizing mucosal antibodies. Our results support the importance to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that elicit mucosal antibodies.One Sentence Summary SARS-CoV-2 infection or combination of infection and vaccination (hybrid immunity) elicit binding and functional mucosal antibody responses superior of those after systemic vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work was funded by the COVID-19 National Research Program (grant number 198412) of the Swiss National Science Foundation.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee at the University Hospital of Geneva (CCER no. 2020-02323).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Introduction Three years into the pandemic, there remains significant uncertainty about the true infection and mortality burden of COVID-19 in the WHO-Africa region. High quality, population-representative studies in Africa are rare and tend to be conducted in national capitals or large cities, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 in rural, low-resource settings. Here, we estimated the spatio-temporal morbidity and mortality burden associated with COVID-19 in a rural health district of Madagascar until the first half of 2021.Methods We integrated a nested seroprevalence study within a pre-existing longitudinal cohort conducted in a representative sample of 1600 households in Ifanadiana District, Madagascar. Socio-demographic and health information was collected in combination with dried blood spots for about 6500 individuals of all ages, which were analysed to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against four specific proteins of SARS-CoV2 in bead-based multiplex immunoassay. We evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in COVID-19 infection history and its associations with several geographic, socio-economic and demographic factors via logistic regressions.Results Eighteen percent of people had been infected by April-June 2021, with seroprevalence increasing with individuals’ age. COVID-19 primarily spread along the only paved road and in major towns during the first epidemic wave, subsequently spreading along secondary roads during the second wave to more remote areas. Wealthier individuals and those with occupations such as commerce and formal employment were at higher risk of being infected in the first wave. Adult mortality increased in 2020, particularly for older men for whom it nearly doubled up to nearly 40 deaths per 1000. Less than 10% of mortality in this period could be directly attributed to COVID-19 deaths given known infection fatality ratios and observed seroprevalence in the district.Conclusion Our study provides a very granular understanding on COVID-19 transmission and mortality in a rural population of sub-Saharan Africa and suggests that the disease burden in these areas may have been substantially underestimated.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by internal funding from Pivot, by the Herrnstein Family Foundation, and by a grant from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (Project ANR-19-CE36-0001-01).

%X Background Widespread human-to-human transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS-CoV-2) stems from a strong affinity for the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme two (ACE2). We investigate the relationship between a patient’s nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription and secondary transmission within a series of concurrent hospital associated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in British Columbia, Canada.Methods Epidemiological case data from the outbreak investigations was merged with public health laboratory records and viral lineage calls, from whole genome sequencing, to reconstruct the concurrent outbreaks using infection tracing transmission network analysis. ACE2 transcription and RNA viral load were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The transmission network was resolved to calculate the number of potential secondary cases. Bivariate and multivariable analyses using Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models was performed to estimate the association between ACE2 transcription the number of SARS-CoV-2 secondary cases.Results The infection tracing transmission network provided n = 76 potential transmission events across n = 103 cases. Bivariate comparisons found that on average ACE2 transcription did not differ between patients and healthcare workers (P = 0.86). High ACE2 transcription was observed in 98.6% of transmission events, either the primary or secondary case had above average ACE2. Multivariable analysis found that the association between ACE2 transcription and the number of secondary transmission events differs between patients and healthcare workers. In health care workers Negative Binomial regression estimated that a one unit change in ACE2 transcription decreases the number of secondary cases (B = −0.132 (95%CI: −0.255 to −0.0181) adjusting for RNA viral load. Conversely, in patients a one unit change in ACE2 transcription increases the number of secondary cases (B = 0.187 (95% CI: 0.0101 to 0.370) adjusting for RNA viral load. Sensitivity analysis found no significant relationship between ACE2 and secondary transmission in health care workers and confirmed the positive association among patients.Conclusion Our study suggests that ACE2 transcription has a positive association with SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission in admitted inpatients, but not health care workers in concurrent hospital associated outbreaks, and it should be further investigated as a risk-factor for viral transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (#434951) and Genome British Columbia (COV-55).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval for the study was sought from the University of British Columbia human ethics board (#H20-01110) which was harmonized with the Fraser Health Authority.

%X Background This study has assessed the protective effect of a new Anti-COVID-19 SA58 Nasal Spray (SA58 Nasal Spray) against SARS-CoV-2 infection under continuous exposure.Methods This is an exploratory open-label, single-arm trial. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SA58 against SARS-CoV-2 family transmission, SA58 was administered to all enrolled family contacts at 3∼6-hour intervals. The frequency of administration and adverse events (AEs) were self-reported by online questionnaire, and RT-PCR tests were used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effectiveness was assessed in comparison to a contemporaneous control group whose information was collected through three follow-up visits. Total effectiveness and single-day effectiveness were calculated.Results The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 62.9% (44/70) in the experimental group and 94.8% (343/362) in the control group. Using SA58 nasal spray at least three times per day could possibly reduce the risk of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by 46.7%∼56.5%. The incidence of AEs was 41.4% and the severity of all AEs was mild.Conclusion Even under the scenario of continuous exposure to SARS-CoV-2, SA58 nasal spray remained effective in blocking viral transmission and was well tolerated.Competing Interest StatementLianhao Wang, Keqiang Sun, Yafeng Bao, Can Wu, Junfan Pu, Junlan Wu and Qiang Gao are employees of Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd.

%X With the majority of CD8+ T cells residing and functioning in tissue, not blood, developing noninvasive methods for in vivo quantification of their biodistribution and kinetics in humans offers the means for studying their key role in adaptive immune response and memory. This study is the first report on using positron emission tomography (PET) dynamic imaging and compartmental kinetic modeling for in vivo measurement of whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ T cells in human subjects. For this, a 89Zr-labeled minibody with high affinity for human CD8 (89Zr-Df-Crefmirlimab) was used with total-body PET in healthy subjects (N=3) and in COVID-19 convalescent patients (N=5). The high detection sensitivity, total-body coverage, and the use of dynamic scans enabled the study of kinetics simultaneously in spleen, bone marrow, liver, lungs, thymus, lymph nodes, and tonsils, at reduced radiation doses compared to prior studies. Analysis and modeling of the kinetics was consistent with T cell trafficking effects expected from immunobiology of lymphoid organs, suggesting early uptake in spleen and bone marrow followed by redistribution and delayed increasing uptake in lymph nodes, tonsils, and thymus. Tissue-to-blood ratios from the first 7 h of CD8-targeted imaging showed significantly higher values in the bone marrow of COVID-19 patients compared to controls, with an increasing trend between 2 and 6 months post-infection, consistent with net influx rates obtained by kinetic modeling and flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood samples. These results provide the platform for using dynamic PET scans and kinetic modelling to study total-body immunological response and memory.Competing Interest StatementRD Badawi and SR Cherry are principal investigators on a grant funded by United Imaging Healthcare.

%X Importance Pregnant women are at increased risk of severe COVID-19, but the contribution of viral RNA load, the presence of infectious virus, and mucosal antibody responses remain understudied.Objective To evaluate the association of COVID-19 outcomes following confirmed infection with vaccination status, mucosal antibody responses, infectious virus recovery and viral RNA levels in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women.Design A retrospective observational cohort study of remnant clinical specimens from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients between October 2020-May 2022.Setting Five acute care hospitals within the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS) in the Baltimore, MD-Washington, DC area.Participants Participants included confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women and matched non-pregnant women (matching criteria included age, race/ethnicity, and vaccination status).Exposure SARS-CoV-2 infection, with documentation of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.Main Outcome(s) The primary dependent measures were clinical COVID-19 outcomes, infectious virus recovery, viral RNA levels, and mucosal anti-spike (S) IgG titers from upper respiratory tract samples. Clinical outcomes were compared using odds ratios (OR), and measures of virus and antibody were compared using either Fisher’s exact test, two-way ANOVA, or regression analyses. Results were stratified according to pregnancy, vaccination status, maternal age, trimester of pregnancy, and infecting SARS-CoV-2 variant.Results(s) A total of 452 individuals (117 pregnant and 335 non-pregnant) were included in the study, with both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals represented. Pregnant women were at increased risk of hospitalization (OR = 4.2; CI = 2.0-8.6), ICU admittance, (OR = 4.5; CI = 1.2-14.2), and of being placed on supplemental oxygen therapy (OR = 3.1; CI =1.3-6.9). An age-associated decrease in anti-S IgG titer and corresponding increase in viral RNA levels (P&lt; 0.001) was observed in vaccinated pregnant, but not non-pregnant, women. Individuals in their 3rd trimester had higher anti-S IgG titers and lower viral RNA levels (P&lt; 0.05) than those in their 1st or 2nd trimesters. Pregnant individuals experiencing breakthrough infections due to the omicron variant had reduced anti-S IgG compared to non-pregnant women (P&lt; 0.05).Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, vaccination status, maternal age, trimester of pregnancy, and infecting SARS-CoV-2 variant were each identified as drivers of differences in mucosal anti-S IgG responses in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women. Observed increased severity of COVID-19 and reduced mucosal antibody responses particularly among pregnant participants infected with the Omicron variant suggest that maintaining high levels of SARS-CoV-2 immunity may be important for protection of this at-risk population.Question Is greater COVID-19 disease severity during pregnancy associated with either reduced mucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 or increased viral RNA levels?Finding In a retrospective cohort of pregnant and non-pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we observed that (1) disease severity, including ICU admission, was greater among pregnant than non-pregnant women; (2) vaccination was associated with reduced recovery of infectious virus in non-pregnant women but not in pregnant women; (3) increased nasopharyngeal viral RNA levels were associated with reduced mucosal IgG antibody responses in pregnant women; and (4) greater maternal age was associated with reduced mucosal IgG responses and increased viral RNA levels, especially among women infected with the Omicron variant.Meaning The findings of this study provide novel evidence that, during pregnancy, lower mucosal antibody responses are associated with reduced control of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and greater disease severity, especially with increasing maternal age. Reduced mucosal antibody responses among vaccinated pregnant women highlight the need for bivalent booster doses during pregnancy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project was supported by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of a financial assistance award [Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation grant to Johns Hopkins University, U01FD005942, awarded to SLK] funded by the Office of Women's Health/FDA/HHS, with additional support provided by NIH/NCI U54CA260492 (SLK and ALC); NIH/NIAID N7593021C00045 (AP); 75D30121C11061 (HHM); U01CK000589 (EYK).

%X The maturation of genomic surveillance in the past decade has enabled tracking of the emergence and spread of epidemics at an unprecedented level. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, genomic data revealed that local epidemics varied considerably in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 lineage importation and persistence, likely due to a combination of COVID-19 restrictions and changing connectivity. Here, we show that local COVID-19 epidemics are driven by regional transmission, including across international boundaries, but can become increasingly connected to distant locations following the relaxation of public health interventions. By integrating genomic, mobility, and epidemiological data, we find abundant transmission occurring between both adjacent and distant locations, supported by dynamic mobility patterns. We find that changing connectivity significantly influences local COVID-19 incidence. Our findings demonstrate a complex meaning of ‘local’ when investigating connected epidemics and emphasize the importance of collaborative interventions for pandemic prevention and mitigation.Competing Interest StatementK.G.A. has received consulting fees and compensated expert testimony on SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic.Funding StatementThe research leading to these results has received funding from the National Institutes of Health (grants U19AI135995, U01AI151812, UL1TR002550, F32AI154824, and R01AI153044) and the CDC contract 7530122C14843.

%X International air travel has been recognized as a crucial factor in the cross-regional transmission of monkeypox (now known as mpox) since this disease rapidly spread across the globe in May 2022. On September 6, 2022, Hong Kong SAR (HK) reported its first imported mpox case with travel history of the United States (US), Canada, and the Philippines. In this study, we estimated the importation risk to HK from 25 international departures from May 1 to September 6, 2022, based on the prevalence of pre-symptomatic mpox cases in the study regions, and time-varying flight mobility evaluated by aggregating multiple open-access air travel datasets (e.g., OpenSky, Aviation Edge). The result indicated that the US had the most significant importation risk of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.95) during the study period, followed by the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada with a risk of 0.29 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.63) and 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.32), respectively. Our study demonstrated that the importation risk of mpox from the US and Canada was substantially higher than other regions, which was aligned with the travel history of the first reported case in HK. Our study provided a simplified computational method for estimating the importation risk of mpox virus based on air travel mobility and disease prevalence. Estimating the international importation risk of mpox is essential for appropriately designing and timely adjusting emergency public health strategies and inbound measures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementthe Key Program for International Science and Technology Cooperation Projects of China [grant no. 2022YFE0112300], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant nos. 61976181, 62261136549, U22B2036], Key Technology Research and Development Program of Science and Technology - Scientific and Technological Innovation Team of Shaanxi Province [grant no. 2020TD-013].Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the emergence of various variants of concern (VoCs) that are associated with increased transmissibility, immune evasion, or differences in disease severity. The emergence of VoCs fueled interest in understanding the potential impact of travel restrictions and surveillance strategies to prevent or delay the early spread of VoCs. We performed phylogenetic analyses and mathematical modeling to study the importation and spread of the VoCs Alpha and Delta in Switzerland in 2020 and 2021. Using a phylogenetic approach, we estimated 383-1,038 imports of Alpha and 455-1,347 imports of Delta into Switzerland. We then used the results from the phylogenetic analysis to parameterize a dynamic transmission that accurately described the subsequent spread of Alpha and Delta. We modeled different counterfactual intervention scenarios to quantify the potential impact of border closures and surveillance of travelers on the spread of Alpha and Delta. We found that implementing border closures after the announcement of VoCs would have been of limited impact to mitigate the spread of VoCs. In contrast, increased surveillance of travelers could prove to be an effective measure for delaying the spread of VoCs in situations where their severity remains unclear. Our study shows how phylogenetic analysis in combination with dynamic transmission models can be used to estimate the number of imported SARS-CoV-2 variants and the potential impact of different intervention scenarios to inform the public health response during the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementMR and CA were supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program - project EpiPose (No 101003688).

%X Background Individuals on hemodialysis are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population due to end-stage kidney disease-induced immunosuppression.Methods 26 hemodialysis patients experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection after 3rd vaccination were matched 1:1 to 26 out of 92 SARS-CoV-2 naïves by age, sex, dialysis vintage and immunosuppressive drugs receiving a 4th vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine. A competitive surrogate neutralization assay was used to monitor vaccination success. To determine infection neutralization titers, Vero-E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC), Omicron sub-lineage BA.1, BA.5, and BQ.1.1. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50, serum dilution factor 1:x) was determined before, four weeks after and 6 months after the 4th vaccination.Results 52 hemodialysis patients received four COVID-19 vaccinations and were followed up for a median of 6.3 months. Patient characteristics did not differ between the matched cohorts. Patients without a SARS-CoV-2 infection had a significant reduction of real virus neutralization capacity for all Omicron sub-lineages after six months (p&lt;0.001 each). Those patients with a virus infection did not experience a reduction of real virus neutralization capacity after six months. Compared to the other Omicron VoC the BQ.1.1 sub-lineage had the lowest virus neutralization capacity.Conclusions SARS-CoV-2-naïve hemodialysis patients had significantly decreased virus neutralization capacity six months after the 4th vaccination whereas patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection had no change in neutralization capacity. This was independent of age, sex, dialysis vintage and immunosuppression. Therefore, in infection-naïve hemodialysis patients a fifth COVID-19 vaccination might be reasonable 6 months after the 4th vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors declare no conflict of interest.

%X The impact of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on the durability of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine-elicited responses, and the effect of homologous boosting has not been well explored. We followed a cohort of healthcare workers for 6 months after receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and a further one month after they received an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose. We assessed longitudinal spike-specific antibody and T cell responses in individuals who had never had SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were infected with either the D614G or Beta variants prior to vaccination. Antibody and T cell responses elicited by the primary dose were durable against several variants of concern over the 6 month follow-up period, regardless of infection history. However, at 6 months after first vaccination, antibody binding, neutralization and ADCC were as much as 33-fold higher in individuals with hybrid immunity compared to those with no prior infection. Antibody cross-reactivity profiles of the previously infected groups were similar at 6 months, unlike at earlier time points suggesting that the effect of immune imprinting diminishes by 6 months. Importantly, an Ad26.COV2.S booster dose increased the magnitude of the antibody response in individuals with no prior infection to similar levels as those with previous infection.The magnitude of spike T cell responses and proportion of T cell responders remained stable after homologous boosting, concomitant with a significant increase in long-lived early differentiated CD4 memory T cells. Thus, these data highlight that multiple antigen exposures, whether through infection and vaccination or vaccination alone, result in similar boosts after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by the South African Medical Research Council (SA MRC) with funds received from the South African Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), including grants 96825, SHIPNCD 76756 and DST/CON 0250/2012.

%X Viruses of concern for quantitative wastewater monitoring are usually selected as a result of an outbreak and subsequent detection in wastewater. However, targeted metagenomics could proactively identify viruses of concern when used as an initial screening tool. To evaluate the utility of targeted metagenomics for wastewater screening, we used ViroCap, a panel of probes designed to target all known vertebrate viruses. Untreated wastewater was collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and building-level manholes associated with vulnerable populations in Houston, TX. We evaluated differences in vertebrate virus detection between WWTP and building-level samples, classified human viruses in wastewater, and performed phylogenetic analysis on astrovirus sequencing reads to evaluate targeted metagenomics for subspecies level classification. Vertebrate viruses varied widely across building-level samples. Rarely detected and abundant viruses were identified in WWTP and building-level samples, including enteric, respiratory, and bloodborne viruses. Furthermore, full length genomes were assembled from astrovirus reads and two human astrovirus serotypes were classified in wastewater samples. This study demonstrates the utility of targeted metagenomics as an initial screening step for public health surveillance.Synopsis This work demonstrates the utility of targeted metagenomic shotgun sequencing to screen for human viruses in centralized and building-level wastewater samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Houston Health Department and grants from the National Science Foundation (CBET 2029025) and seed funds from Rice University.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X We have developed a rapid and highly specific assay for detecting and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infections by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). As MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers are available in a clinical setting, our assay has the potential to serve as alternative to the commonly used reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Sample preparation prior to MALDI-TOF-MS involves the tryptic digestion of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, followed by an enrichment of virus-specific peptides from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein via magnetic antibody beads. Our MALDI-TOF-MS method allows the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein as low as 8 amol/μl. MALDI-TOF mass spectra are obtained in just a few seconds, which makes our MS-based assay suitable for a high-throughput screening of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare facilities in addition to PCR. Due to the specific detection of virus peptides, different SARS-CoV-2 variants are readily distinguished from each other. Specifically, we show that our MALDI-TOF-MS assay discriminates SARS-CoV-2 strain B.1.617.2 “delta variant” from all other variants in patients’ samples, making our method highly valuable to monitor the emergence of new virus variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi, ZIM project KK5096401SK0AS).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of the University Clinics Leipzig gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an ever-increasing threat to global health. Wastewater-based surveillance is an emerging methodology that objectively enables an inclusive and comprehensive assessment of population AMR in an observed sewershed. Here we compared the resistome of two tertiary-care hospitals with two separate neighborhoods, using complimentary targeted qPCR and metagenomics of wastewater before and after selective culture enrichment for clinically important Gram negatives. In total 26 ARG-type (1225 ARG-subtypes) were found across all samples, in which β-lactam ARG was the richest (the number of different ARG-subtypes found) followed by multidrug, fluoroquinolone, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) and aminoglycoside. The composition of ARGs in wastewater differed between raw wastewater pellets and culture-enriched wastewater samples and the resistomes clustered based on the type of location (Hospitals vs neighborhoods). Hospital wastewater was found to have higher diversity and greater abundance of ARGs compared to neighborhood wastewater when the composition profiles of ARGs in both raw and culture-enriched wastewater pellets. Clinically relevant ARG (i.e., VIM, NDM metallo-ß-lactamases) were detected in culture enrichment samples that were not identified in raw samples, despite a lower targeted sequencing depth. Wastewater-based surveillance is an effective, and potentially extremely important and powerful tool that could be developed to augment hospital-based infection control and antimicrobial stewardship programs, creating a safer space for those receiving care.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Alberta Health.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Conjoint region health ethics board (CHREB) of the University of Calgary approved this study; REB20-1252.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values can be used to estimate the viral burden of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and predict population-level epidemic trends. We investigated the use of machine learning (ML) and epidemic transmission modeling based on Ct value distribution for SARS-CoV-2 incidence prediction during an Omicron-predominant period.Methods Using simulated data, we developed a ML model to predict the reproductive number based on Ct value distribution, and validated it on out-of-sample province-level data. We also developed an epidemiological model and fitted it to province-level data to accurately predict incidence.Results Based on simulated data, the ML model predicted the reproductive number with highest performance on out-of-sample province-level data. The epidemiological model was validated on outbreak data, and fitted to province-level data, and accurately predicted incidence.ConclusionsThese modeling approaches can complement traditional surveillance, especially when diagnostic testing practices change over time. The models can be tailored to different epidemiological settings and used in real time to guide public health interventions.Funding This work was supported by funding from Genome BC, Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research and British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Foundation to C.A.H.

%X Background SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, can be detected in stool samples and subsequently shed in the sewage system. The field of Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) aims to use this valuable source of data for epidemiological surveillance, as it has the potential to identify unreported infections and to anticipate the need for diagnostic tests.Objectives The objectives of this study were to analyze the absolute concentration of genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 shed in Catalonia’s wastewater during the Omicron peak in January 2022, and to develop a mathematical model capable of using wastewater data to estimate the actual number of infections and the temporal relationship between reported and unreported infections.Methods We collected twenty-four-hour composite 1-liter samples of wastewater from 16 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Catalonia on a weekly basis. We incorporated this data into a compartmental epidemiological model that distinguishes between reported and unreported infections and uses a convolution process to estimate the genome copies shed in sewage.Results The 16 WWTPs showed an average correlation of 0.88 ± 0.08 (ranging from 0.96 to 0.71) and an average delay of 8.7 ± 5.4 days (ranging from 0 to 20 days). Our model estimates that about 53% of the population in our study had been infected during the period under investigation, compared to the 19% of cases that were detected. This under-reporting was especially high between November and December 2021, with values up to 10. Our model also allowed us to estimate the maximum quantity of genome copies shed in a gram of feces by an infected individual, which ranged from 4.15 × 107 gc/g to 1.33 × 108 gc/g.Discussion Although wastewater data can be affected by uncertainties and may be subject to fluctuations, it can provide useful insights into the current trend of an epidemic. As a complementary tool, WBE can help account for unreported infections and anticipate the need for diagnostic tests, particularly when testing rates are affected by human behavior-related biases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was partially funded by the Catalan Agency for Water (ACA), the Catalan Public Health Agency (ASPCAT) from the Department of Health, and the Health Innovation Program from the General Research Directorate (DGRIS) of the Generalitat de Catalunya.

%X Background While anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics have been well described in large populations of vaccinated individuals, we still poorly understand how they evolve during a natural infection and how this impacts viral clearance.Methods For that purpose, we analyzed the kinetics of both viral load and neutralizing antibody levels in a prospective cohort of individuals during acute infection by Alpha variant.Results Using a mathematical model, we show that the progressive increase in neutralizing antibodies leads to a shortening of the half-life of both infected cells and infectious viral particles. We estimated that the neutralizing activity reached 90% of its maximal level within 8 days after symptoms onset and could reduce the half-life of both infected cells and infectious virus by a 6-fold factor, thus playing a key role to achieve rapid viral clearance. Using this model, we conducted a simulation study to predict in a more general context the protection conferred by the existence of pre-existing neutralization, due to either vaccination or prior infection. We predicted that a neutralizing activity, as measured by ED50 &gt;103, could reduce by 50% the risk of having viral load detectable by standard PCR assays and by 99% the risk of having viral load above the threshold of cultivable virus.Conclusions This threshold value for the neutralizing activity could be used to identify individuals with poor protection against disease acquisition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04703114Funding StatementThe AMBUCOV study was supported by the Fonds IMMUNOV, for Innovation in Immunopathology.

%X The wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) of SARS-CoV-2 is a quick and cost-effective method of tracking virus transmission. However, few studies reported on campus or in academic or residential settings worldwide. In this study, we demonstrated the WBE approach to detect, monitor, and evaluate genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2 fragments in a sewage treatment plant (STP) located on the campus of CSIR National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India. Herein we describe the early warning capability of WBE, with viral load rise in campus sewage water up to 14 days before its clinical detection. This was supported further by a significant correlation between SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and clinically reported COVID-19 cases on campus. Additionally, we comprehended the probable targets missed by the quantitative qRT-PCR using amplicon-based sequencing due to low viral load. The analysis revealed the presence of signature mutations of the Omicron (S:N679K, S:N764K, S:D796Y, N:P13L, ORF1a:T3255I, ORF1a:K856R, ORF1a:P3395H, and N:S413R) before the lineage was first detected globally. Further, we used Lineage decomposition (LCS) tool to detect the Variant of Concern (VOC)/Variant of Interest (VOI) signals upto a month earlier in sewage water samples. The analysis also indicated the transition of lineage from Delta to Omicron in late Decemeber,2021. This is the first study in India highlighting the use of on-campus STP to evaluate the local spread of SARS-CoV-2, which could aid in preventing COVID-19 in academic institutes/universities.

%X Background Serological surveys have been the gold standard to estimate the numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections, epidemic dynamics, and disease severity. Serological assays have decaying sensitivity with time that can bias their results, but there is a lack of guidelines to account for this phenomenon for SARS-CoV-2.Aim Our goal is to assess the sensitivity decay of seroassays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections, the dependence of this decay on assay characteristics, and to provide a simple method to correct for this phenomenon.Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. We included studies testing previously diagnosed individuals, without any SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and excluded studies of cohorts highly unrepresentative of the general population (e.g. hospitalised patients).Results Of the 488 screened studies, 76 studies reporting on 50 different seroassays were included in the analysis. Sensitivity decay depends strongly on the antigen and the analytic technique used by the assay, with average sensitivities ranging between 26% and 98% at 6 months after infection, depending on assay characteristics. We find that a third of the included assays depart considerably from manufacturer specifications after 6 months.Conclusions Seroassay sensitivity decay depends on assay characteristics, and for some types of assays it can make manufacturer specifications highly unreliable. We provide a tool to correct for this phenomenon, and to assess the risk of decay for a given assay. Our analysis can guide the design and interpretation of serosurveys for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, and quantify systematic biases in the existing serology literature.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive specific funding from any source.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All the data used in this manuscript were openly available in previously published studies and official reports.

%X Background The performance of rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 (Ag-RDT) in temporal relation to symptom onset or exposure is unknown, as is the impact of vaccination on this relationship.Objective To evaluate the performance of Ag-RDT compared with RT-PCR based on day after symptom onset or exposure in order to decide on ‘when to test’.Design, Setting, and Participants The Test Us at Home study was a longitudinal cohort study that enrolled participants over 2 years old across the United States between October 18, 2021 and February 4, 2022. All participants were asked to conduct Ag-RDT and RT-PCR testing every 48 hours over a 15-day period. Participants with one or more symptoms during the study period were included in the Day Post Symptom Onset (DPSO) analyses, while those who reported a COVID-19 exposure were included in the Day Post Exposure (DPE) analysis.Exposure Participants were asked to self-report any symptoms or known exposures to SARS-CoV-2 every 48-hours, immediately prior to conducting Ag-RDT and RT-PCR testing. The first day a participant reported one or more symptoms was termed DPSO 0, and the day of exposure was DPE 0. Vaccination status was self-reported.Main Outcome and Measures Results of Ag-RDT were self-reported (positive, negative, or invalid) and RT-PCR results were analyzed by a central laboratory. Percent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 and sensitivity of Ag-RDT and RT-PCR by DPSO and DPE were stratified by vaccination status and calculated with 95% confidence intervals.Results A total of 7,361 participants enrolled in the study. Among them, 2,086 (28.3%) and 546 (7.4%) participants were eligible for the DPSO and DPE analyses, respectively. Unvaccinated participants were nearly twice as likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than vaccinated participants in event of symptoms (PCR+: 27.6% vs 10.1%) or exposure (PCR+: 43.8% vs. 22.2%). The highest proportion of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals tested positive on DPSO 2 and DPE 5-8. Performance of RT-PCR and Ag-RDT did not differ by vaccination status. Ag-RDT detected 78.0% (95% Confidence Interval: 72.56-82.61) of PCR-confirmed infections by DPSO 4. For exposed participants, Ag-RDT detected 84.9% (95% CI: 75.0-91.4) of PCR-confirmed infections by day five post-exposure (DPE 5).Conclusions and Relevance Performance of Ag-RDT and RT-PCR was highest on DPSO 0-2 and DPE 5 and did not differ by vaccination status. These data suggests that serial testing remains integral to enhancing the performance of Ag-RDT.Competing Interest StatementVK is principal, and TS, SS, CN, and EH are employees of the health care technology company CareEvolution, which was contracted to configure the smartphone study app, provide operational and logistical support, and collaborate on overall research approach.

%X We compared neutralizing antibody responses to BA.4/5, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1.5 Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants after a bivalent or ancestral COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine or post-vaccination infection. We found that the bivalent booster elicited moderately high antibody titers against BA.4/5 that were approximately two-fold higher against all Omicron variants than titers elicited by the monovalent booster. The bivalent booster elicited low but similar titers against both XBB and XBB.1.5 variants.

%X SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection of vaccinated individuals is increasingly common with the circulation of highly immune evasive and transmissible Omicron variants. Here, we report the dynamics and durability of recalled spike-specific humoral immunity following BA.1 or BA.2 breakthrough infection, with longitudinal sampling up to 8 months post-infection. Both BA.1 and BA.2 infection robustly boosted neutralisation activity against the infecting strain while expanding breadth against other Omicron strains. Cross-reactive memory B cells against both ancestral and Omicron spike were predominantly expanded by infection, with limited recruitment of de novo Omicron-specific B cells or antibodies. Modelling of neutralisation titres predicts that protection from symptomatic reinfection against antigenically similar strains will be remarkably durable, but is undermined by novel emerging strains with further neutralisation escape.One sentence summary Omicron breakthrough infection elicits durable neutralising activity by recalling cross-reactive vaccine-elicited memory B cells.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statement This study was funded by: - Australian National Health and Medical Research Council grants 1149990, 1162760 and 2004398 - Australian Medical Research Future Fund grants 2005544 and 2013870 - The Victorian Government - Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Investigator or Fellowship grants (HXT, MK, DAW, MPD, SJK, JAJ, AKW) - Melbourne Postdoctoral Fellowship (WSL) Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee gave ethical approval for this work.

%X Background The correlate(s) of protection against SARS-CoV-2 remain incompletely defined. Additional information regarding the combinations of antibody and T cell-mediated immunity which can protect against (re)infection are needed.Methods We conducted a population-based, longitudinal cohort study including 1044 individuals of varying SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection statuses. We assessed Spike (S)- and Nucleocapsid (N)-IgG and wildtype, delta, and omicron neutralizing antibodies. In a subset of 328 individuals, we evaluated S, Membrane (M) and N-specific T cells. 3 months later, we reassessed antibody (n=964) and T cell (n=141) responses and evaluated factors associated with protection from (re)infection.Results At study start, &gt;98% of participants were S-IgG seropositive. N-IgG and M/N-T cell responses increased over time, indicating viral (re)exposure, despite existing S-IgG. Compared to N-IgG, M/N-T cells were a more sensitive measure of viral exposure. N-IgG titers in the top 33% of participants, omicron neutralizing antibodies in the top 25%, and S-specific T cell responses were all associated with reduced likelihood of (re)infection over time.Conclusions Population-level SARS-CoV-2 immunity is S-IgG-dominated, but heterogenous. M/N T cell responses can distinguish previous infection from vaccination, and monitoring a combination of N-IgG, omicron neutralizing antibodies and S-T cell responses may help estimate protection against SARS-CoV-2 (re)infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe Corona Immunitas research network is coordinated by the Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+) and funded by fundraising of SSPH+ including funds of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and private funders (ethical guidelines for funding stated by SSPH+ were respected), by funds of the cantons of Switzerland (Vaud, Zurich, and Basel), and by institutional funds of the Universities.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich (BASEC Registration No. 2020-01247) and registered (ISRCTN registry 18181860, date of registration 13 July 2020, retrospectively registered).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Tissue-resident lymphocytes provide organ-adapted protection against invading pathogens. Whereas their biology has been examined in great detail in various infection models, their generation and functionality in response to vaccination has not been comprehensively analyzed in humans. We therefore studied SARS-CoV2 mRNA-vaccine-specific T cells in surgery specimens of kidney, liver, lung, bone marrow and spleen in comparison to paired blood samples from largely virus-naïve individuals. As opposed to lymphoid tissues, non-lymphoid organs harbored significantly elevated frequencies of Spike-specific CD4+ T cells compared to paired peripheral blood showing hallmarks of tissue residency and an expanded memory pool. Organ-derived, vaccine-specific T helper (Th) cells were characterized by increased portions of multifunctional cells over those detected in blood. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed functional rather than organ-specific clusters of Spike-reactive Th cells, indicating similar diversification programs across tissues. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis indicated that the TCR sequence is a major determinant of transcriptomic state in tissue-resident, vaccine-specific CD4+ T cells. In summary, our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV2 vaccination entails acquisition of tissue memory and residency features in organs distant from the inoculation site, thereby contributing to our understanding of how local tissue protection might be accomplished.One sentence summary SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccination-induced CD4+ Th cells reside in both human lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs showing distinct adaptations in tissues with respect to memory differentiation, retention and function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementKK is supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (KO-2270/7-1, KO-2270/4-1, KO-2270/8-1), Wilhelm-Sander Stiftung (2022.035.1), Zentrales Innovationsprogramm Mittelstand (KK5463201BA2) and unconditional project funding from Chiesi GmbH.

%X Healthcare workers in Indonesia acquired a complete 2 doses of Sinovac in early 2021 and first booster dose of Moderna in July 2021. In August 2022, the ministry of health prioritized healthcare workers to acquire the second booster dose of Moderna as antibody levels from the year before may have waned. We conducted a sequential serosurvey aimed to determine the level of SARS CoV2 S-RBD antibody reached by the first vaccine, after the first booster, and before the second booster to understand the dynamics of the antibody level. COVID-19 antibody test was conducted using the FastBioRBDtm test with a maximum limit detection level of 4000 BAU/mL. First serosurvey which was conducted in June 2021, one to six months after Sinovac vaccination, showed a median antibody level of 41.4 BAU/mL (IQR 10 – 629.4 BAU/mL). The second serosurvey was conducted one month (August 2021) after the first Moderna booster vaccine, and showed a median level of 4000 BAU/mL (IQR 3081 – 4000 BAU/mL). While the last serosurvey conducted a year (August 2022) after the booster, showed 4000 BAU/mL (IQR 4000 – 4000 BAU/mL). Only 39 (11.9%) healthcare workers have antibody levels below the maximum level of 4000 BAU./mL We did not see the waning of antibody levels among healthcare workers approximately 1 year after the booster. It increases perhaps due to the natural infection caused by the omicron variant outbreak in early 2022. Based on this fact, we suggest considering if the second booster dose is really necessary. The limited vaccine supply can better be given to the person or other high-risk groups of patients who has a low level of antibody based on serological testing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe author(s) received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.Not ApplicableThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Health Research Ethics Committee of Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Number 93 LB.02.01/X.6.5/117/2022.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.Not ApplicableI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Antibodies are used to estimate prevalence of past infection. However, T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 may more accurately define prevalence because SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies wane. In November-December 2021, we studied serological and cellular immune responses in residents of rural Kenya who had not experienced any respiratory symptom nor had contact with COVID-19 cases. Among participants we detected anti-spike antibodies in 41.0% and T cell responses against ≥2 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 82.5%, which implies that serosurveys underestimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in settings where asymptomatic infections prevail. Distinct from cellular immunity in European and Asian COVID-19 convalescents, strong T cell immunogenicity was observed against viral accessory proteins in these asymptomatic Africans, as well as a higher IL-10/IFN-γ ratio cytokine profile, suggesting that environmental or genetic factors modulate pro-inflammatory responses.Funding U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Global Health Protection.

%X Voluntary participation of the public in disease surveillance can be encouraged by deploying user-friendly sample collection processes that can minimise the discomfort to the participants. This study evaluated the suitability of saline gargle-based sample collection for genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, which included 589 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected from Nagpur city in central India from March to December 2021. The SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) using the oxford nanopore technologies next-generation sequencing platform. Out of 589 samples, 500 samples qualified for the WGS, and the results revealed eight different clades of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing 37 different Pango-lineage types. The mutation mapping analysis of the variants identified in this study showed six mutations of interest and one mutation of concern E484K in the spike glycoprotein region. Our findings indicate that non-invasive gargle-based genomic surveillance is scalable and does not need significant changes to the existing workflow post-sample collection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported and funded by CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI), Nagpur, India, approved the research.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X With numerous variations in the Spike protein, including concentrated mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant significantly shifted in the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand individual patient risk profiles in the face of rapidly emerging variants, there is an interest in sensitive serological tests capable of analyzing patient IgG response to multiple variants in parallel. Here, we present a serological test based on yeast surface display and serum biopanning that characterizes immune profiles against SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants. We used this yeast-based multi-variant serology method to examine IgG titers from 30 serum samples derived from COVID-19-convalescent and vaccinated individuals in Switzerland and assessed the relative affinity of polyclonal serum IgG for Wuhan (B lineage), Delta (B.1.617.2 lineage), and Omicron (B.1.1.529 lineage) RBD domains. We validated and benchmarked our system against a commercial lateral flow assay and showed strong concordance. Our assay demonstrates that serum IgGs from patients recovered from severe COVID-19 between March-June 2021 bound tightly to both original Wuhan and Delta RBD variants, but became indistinguishable from background when assayed against Omicron, representing an affinity loss of &gt;10-20 fold. Our yeast immunoassay is easily tailored and parallelized with newly emerging RBD variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the University of Basel, ETH Zurich, the Basel University Hospital, the Swiss Nanoscience Institute, the Mexican CONACYT program, the Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR Molecular Systems Engineering), and the Botnar Research Centre for Child Health (FTC Covid-19 to MAN and YG).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Ethical Committee of Northwest-Central Switzerland (EKNZ) overseeing the University Hospital Basel gave ethical approval for this work (Project-ID 2021-00214).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X T cell correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination (‘vaccine breakthrough’) are incompletely defined, especially the specific contributions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We studied 279 volunteers in the Protective Immunity from T Cells in Healthcare Workers (PITCH) UK study, including 32 cases (with SARS-CoV-2 positive testing after two vaccine doses during the Delta-dominant era) and 247 controls (no positive test nor anti-nucleocapsid seroconversion during this period). 28 days after second vaccination, before all breakthroughs occurred, cases had lower ancestral S- and RBD-specific immunoglobulin G titres and S1- and S2-specific T cell interferon gamma (IFNγ) responses compared with controls. In a subset of matched cases and controls, cases had lower CD4+ and CD8+ IFNγ and tumour necrosis factor responses to Delta S peptides with reduced CD8+ responses to Delta versus ancestral peptides compared with controls. Our findings support a protective role for T cells against Delta breakthrough infection.Competing Interest StatementS.D. is a Scientific Advisor to the Scottish Parliament on COVID-19 for which she receives a fee.

%T Vaccine waning and immune escape drive the second surge of Omicron spread in Hong Kong: A modeling study

%X The Omicron subvariant BA.2 caused the start of the fifth epidemic wave in Hong Kong in early 2022, leading to a significant outbreak and triggering more people get immunized in a population with relatively low vaccine coverage. About half a year later, a second outbreak, largely dominated by BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, began to spread, which peaked within few months. How the waning of the vaccine protection and the immune escape properties together with other factors, including social distancing and outdoor temperature, drove the second surge of infections is unknown. The challenge is that basic epidemic modeling is not able to capture longitudinal change in vaccine waning and dose interval. We developed mathematical equations to formulate continuous change of vaccine waning after observing empirical serological data and incorporate them into a multi-strain discrete-time SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model. Using the reported cases during the first outbreak as the training set together with daily vaccination rates, population mobility and temperature, the model successfully predicted the second surge and the replacement by BA.4/5, leading to a cumulative number of cases about 543,600 (7.27% of total population). If vaccine protection maintained without decreasing, the number of predicted cumulative cases reduced 35%. If perfect vaccine coverage reached (100%) by 1st June, the number of cases was only partially reduced 18.65%. Moderate level of social distancing (10% reduction in population mobility) reduced only 13.78% cases, which was not able to prevent the second surge. The results suggest future local outbreaks will remain as long as new immune escape happens with waning immunity, even if the moderate level of social distancing is present. Therefore, a more accurate model forecasting considering waning immunity remains needed in order to allow a better preparation of the next outbreaks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Evaluating vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a full vaccine series and booster doses against COVID-19 is important for health decision-making.Methods We systematically searched papers that evaluated VE of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Embase, Scopus, and preprint servers (bioRxiv and medRxiv) published from November 26th, 2021 to June 27th, 2022 (for full doses and first booster), and to January 8th, 2023 (for the second booster). The pooled VE against Omicron-associated symptomatic or any infection as well as severe events are estimated in a meta-analysis framework.Results From 2,552 citations identified, a total of 42 were included. The vaccination of the first booster provided stronger protection against Omicron than the full doses alone, shown by the VE estimates of 53.1% (95% CI: 48.0−57.8) vs. 28.6% (95% CI: 18.5−37.4) against infection and 82.5% (95% CI: 77.8−86.2) vs. 57.3% (95% CI: 48.5−64.7) against severe disease. The second booster offered strong protection among adults within 60 days of vaccination against infection (VE=53.1%, 95% CI: 48.0−57.8) and severe disease (VE=87.3% (95% CI: 75.5-93.4), comparable to the first booster with corresponding VE estimates of 59.9% against infection and 84.8% against severe disease. The VEs of the booster doses against severe disease among adults sustained beyond 60 days, 77.6% (95% CI: 69.4−83.6) for the first and 85.9% (95% CI: 80.3−89.9) for the second booster. The VE against infection was less sustainable regardless of dose type. Pure mRNA vaccines provided comparable protection to partial mRNA vaccines, but both provided higher protection than non-mRNA vaccination.Conclusion One or two booster doses of current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provide considerable protection against Omicron infection and substantial and sustainable protection against Omicron-induced severe clinical outcomes.Funding US CDC U01 CK000670Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearchers YY, IL and SS in this study were funded by US CDC U01 CK000670 Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Rationale As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progressed, hospital mortality among patients admitted with COVID-19 decreased; however, its mechanism remains unclear.Objective To determine underlying factors that might explain the declining observed mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Methods This observational study used a prospective COVID-19 clinical database compiled by a 15-hospital health system. Participants were persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (n=185,636), among whom 26,872 were hospitalized for COVID-19 from 3/1/2020 to 6/1/2022.Measurements Endpoints were hospital and 60-day mortality assessed by randomForests-for-survival machine learning using patient demographics, medical history, symptoms, and admission laboratory test results.Main Results Mortality of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 fell from 11% in 3/2020 to 3.7% in 3/2022; 60-day mortality was 17% in 5/2020 and 4.7% in 5/2022. Advanced age was the most important predictor of mortality, followed by admission laboratory test results. Risk-adjusted 60-day mortality was 15% had all patients been admitted in 3/2020, minimally unchanged at 12% had they been admitted in 5/2022. Dissociation between observed and predicted mortality was largely explained by change in admission patient profile, particularly admission laboratory test results. Transition to intensive care occurred rapidly for those predicted to do poorly.Conclusion Mortality from COVID-19 requiring hospitalization has declined as the pandemic has evolved, but surprisingly, persists for 60 days following admission.

%X The emergence of COVID-19 stressed country health systems up to the point of triggering compulsory public health interventions to flatten the epidemic curve. Most of the interventions during the first year of the pandemic were non-pharmaceutical and aimed to reduce the contact rate of the people, which reduced the transmission rate of all respiratory pathogens, but had a large social and financial burden. SARS-CoV-2 specific interventions included screening, that is testing of asymptomatic people, which was largely facilitated by the availability of self-testing lateral flow antigen detection devices. The importance of self-testing interventions in controlling COVID-19 epidemic is not well-documented. We study as a paradigm-model the self-testing COVID-19 mass screening program that was implemented in Greece, involving large, susceptible populations taking tests routinely and pre-emptively so as to enable early detection of infections. Using a novel compartmental model we quantify the effectiveness of the program in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. Conservative estimates indicate that the program reduced the reproductive number by 4%, hospital admissions by 25% and deaths by 20%, which translated into approximately 20,000 averted hospitalizations and 2,000 averted deaths between April-December 2021. Self-testing mass screening programs are efficient interventions with minimal social and financial burden, thus they are invaluable tools to be considered in pandemic preparedness.Competing Interest StatementSpyros Sapounas is serving as the Vice President of the Greek National Public Health Organization.

%T Wastewater genomic surveillance tracks the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant across England

%X Background Many countries have moved into a new stage of managing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with minimal restrictions and reduced testing in the population, leading to reduced genomic surveillance of virus variants in individuals. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can provide an alternative means of tracking virus variants in the population but is lacking verifications of its comparability to individual testing data.Methods We analysed more than 19,000 samples from 524 wastewater sites across England at least twice a week between November 2021 and February 2022, capturing sewage from &gt;70% of the English population. We used amplicon-based sequencing and the phylogeny based de-mixing tool Freyja to estimate SARS-CoV-2 variant frequencies and compared these to the variant dynamics observed in individual testing data from clinical and community settings.Findings We show that wastewater data can reconstruct the spread of the Omicron variant across England since November 2021 in close detail and aligns closely with epidemiological estimates from individual testing data. We also show the temporal and spatial spread of Omicron within London. Our wastewater data further reliably track the transition between Omicron subvariants BA1 and BA2 in February 2022 at regional and national levels.Interpretation Our demonstration that WBE can track the fast-paced dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variant frequencies at a national scale and closely match individual testing data in time shows that WBE can reliably fill the monitoring gap left by reduced individual testing in a more affordable way.Funding Department of Health and Social Care, UK, Natural Environmental Research Council, UK, COG-UKEvidence before this study Genomic monitoring of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 variants has been introduced in several countries and shown to effectively detect the spread of known variants in multiple studies. However, verification of its alignment with individual testing data at a national scale has so far been reported only for Austria, where sampling covered around 5.4million people. Further and larger scale verifications of the reliability of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) are needed to increase confidence in its use for public health monitoring.Added value of this study We provide evidence that WBE was able to closely track the spread of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron, as well as its sub lineage dynamics, at a regional and national scale across England. Our sampling covered &gt;70% of the English population, equivalent to 39.4 million people. We thereby demonstrate the scalability of our approach to national levels. We also show how WBE is able to track dynamics in different regions of the UK and at a finer scale within London. Its close alignment, in estimated epidemiological timings, with results from intensive individual testing in the same timeframe provides evidence that wastewater-based monitoring can be a reliable alternative when large scale data from individual testing is not available.Implications of all the available evidence Altogether, evidence is accumulating that WBE is a reliable approach for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics and informing public health measures across spatial scales.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocols https://www.protocols.io/view/wastewater-sequencing-using-the-easyseq-rc-pcr-sar-bx6dpra6 Funding StatementFunding was provided by DHSC UK (2020_097) and NERC (NE/V003860/1).

%X In late 2022, China transitioned from a strict ‘zero-COVID’ policy to rapidly abandoning nearly all interventions and data reporting. This raised great concern about the presumably-rapid but undisclosed spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in a very large population of very low pre-existing immunity. A quantitative understanding of the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 during this period is urgently needed. Here, by modeling a combination of case count and survey data, we show that Omicron spread extremely fast, at a rate of 0.42/day (95% CrI: [0.35, 0.51]/day) after the full exit from zero-COVID policies on Dec. 7, 2022. Consequently, we estimate that the vast majority of the population (97%, 95% CrI [95%, 99%]) was infected during December, with the nation-wide epidemic peaking on Dec. 23. Overall, our results highlight the extremely high transmissibility of the variant and the importance of proper design of intervention exit strategies to avoid large infection waves.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Understanding the differences in serum cross-neutralizing responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron sub-lineages BA.5, BA.2.75, and BQ.1.1, elicited by exposure to distinct antigens is essential for developing COVID-19 booster vaccines with enhanced cross-protection against antigenically distinct variants. However, fairly comparing the impact of breakthrough infection on serum neutralizing responses to several variants with distinct epidemic timing is challenging because responses after breakthrough infection are affected by the exposure interval between vaccination and infection. We assessed serum cross-neutralizing responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron sub-lineages, in individuals with breakthrough infections before or during the Omicron BA.1 epidemic. To understand the differences in serum cross-neutralizing responses after pre-Omicron or Omicron breakthrough infection, we used Bayesian hierarchical modeling to correct the cross-neutralizing responses for the exposure interval between vaccination and breakthrough infection. The exposure interval required to generate saturated cross-neutralizing potency against each variant differed by variant, with variants more antigenically distant from the ancestral strain requiring a longer interval. Additionally, Omicron breakthrough infection was estimated to have higher impact than booster vaccination and pre-Omicron breakthrough infection on inducing serum neutralizing responses to the ancestral strain and Omicron sub-lineages. However, the breadth of cross-neutralizing responses to Omicron sub-lineages, including BQ.1.1, after Omicron or pre-Omicron breakthrough infection with the ideal exposure interval were estimated to be comparable. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing the interval between vaccine doses for maximizing the breadth of cross-neutralizing activity elicited by booster vaccines with or without Omicron antigen.Significance Statement SARS-CoV-2 infections after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines with the ancestral spike antigen induce high serum neutralizing responses against Omicron sub-lineages, which are antigenically distant from the ancestral antigen. In individuals with breakthrough infections, the exposure interval from vaccination to infection is critical for the induction of serum cross-neutralizing activity. We used statistical modeling to estimate the serum neutralizing response to Omicron sub-lineages corrected for the influence of different exposure intervals between vaccination and breakthrough infection in individuals with pre-Omicron and Omicron breakthrough infections. This enabled us to assess fairly the effects of exposure to distinct antigens on inducing serum cross-neutralizing responses with the ideal exposure interval, and revealed the clinical significance of optimizing the dose interval in COVID-19 booster vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (JSPS KAKENHI) grant 21K20768 (to SMi), by Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (MHLW) grants 20HA2001 (to TS), and 21HA2005 (to TS), and by Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) grants JP21fk0108104 (to TS), JP22fk0108637 (to TS), and JP22fk0108141(to TS).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background As we enter the fourth year of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections still cause high morbidity and mortality in the United States. During 2020-2022, COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in the United States and by far the leading cause among infectious diseases. Vaccination uptake remains low despite this being an effective burden reducing intervention. The development of COVID-19 therapeutics provides hope for mitigating severe clinical outcomes. This modeling study examines combined strategies of vaccination and treatment to reduce the burden of COVID-19 epidemics over the next decade.Methods We use a validated mathematical model to evaluate the reduction of incident cases, hospitalized cases, and deaths in the United States through 2033 under various levels of vaccination and treatment coverage. We assume that future seasonal transmission patterns for COVID-19 will be similar to those of influenza virus. We account for the waning of infection-induced immunity and vaccine-induced immunity in a future with stable COVID-19 dynamics. Due to uncertainty in the duration of immunity following vaccination or infection, we consider two exponentially-distributed waning rates, with means of 365 days (one year) and 548 days (1.5 years). We also consider treatment failure, including rebound frequency, as a possible treatment outcome.Results As expected, universal vaccination is projected to eliminate transmission and mortality. Under current treatment coverage (13.7%) and vaccination coverage (49%), averages of 89,000 annual deaths (548-day waning) and 120,000 annual deaths (365-day waning) are expected by the end of this decade. Annual mortality in the United States can be reduced below 50,000 per year with &gt;81% annual vaccination coverage, and below 10,000 annual deaths with &gt;84% annual vaccination coverage. Universal treatment reduces hospitalizations by 88% and deaths by 93% under current vaccination coverage. A reduction in vaccination coverage requires a comparatively larger increase in treatment coverage in order for hospitalization and mortality levels to remain unchanged.Conclusions Adopting universal vaccination and universal treatment goals in the United States will likely lead to a COVID-19 mortality burden below 50,000 deaths per year, a burden comparable to that of influenza virus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFY is supported by contract No. HHS N272201400007C from NIH/NIAID Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance.

%X Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) have become an invaluable tool for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. However, concerns have been raised regarding the ability of existing RATs to effectively detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We compared the performance of eight commercially available, emergency use authorized RATs against the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants using individual patient and serially diluted pooled clinical samples. The RATs exhibited lower sensitivity for Omicron samples when using PCR Cycle threshold (CT) value (a proxy for RNA concentration) as the comparator. Interestingly, however, they exhibited similar sensitivity for Omicron and Delta samples when using quantitative antigen concentration as the comparator. We further found that the Omicron samples had lower ratios of antigen to RNA, which offers a potential explanation for the apparent lower sensitivity of RATs for that variant when using CT value as a reference. Our findings underscore the complexity in assessing RAT performance against emerging variants and highlight the need for ongoing evaluation in the face of changing population immunity and virus evolution.Competing Interest StatementALG reports contract testing from Abbott, Cepheid, Novavax, Pfizer, Janssen, and Hologic, and research support from Gilead and Merck, outside of the described work.

%X Serological population surveillance can elucidate immunity landscapes against SARS-CoV-2 variants and are critical in monitoring infectious disease spread, evolution, and outbreak risks. However, current serological tests fall short of capturing complex humoral immune responses from different communities. Here, we report a machine-learning (ML)-aided nanobiosensor that can simultaneously quantify antibodies against the ancestral strain and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 with epitope resolution. Our approach is based on a multiplexed, rapid, and label-free nanoplasmonic biosensor, which can detect past infection and vaccination status and is sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 variants. After training an ML model with antigen-specific antibody datasets from four COVID-19 immunity groups (naïve, convalescent, vaccinated, and convalescent-vaccinated), we tested our approach on 100 blind blood samples collected in Dane County, WI. Our results are consistent with public epidemiological data, demonstrating that our user-friendly and field-deployable nanobiosensor can capture community-representative public health trends and help manage COVID-19 and future outbreaks.Competing Interest StatementM.

%X Early case detection is critical to preventing onward transmission of COVID-19 by enabling prompt isolation of index infections, and identification and quarantining of contacts. Timeliness and completeness of ascertainment depend on the surveillance strategy employed. We use rapid prototype modelling to quickly investigate the effectiveness of testing strategies, to aid decision making. Models are developed with a focus on providing relevant results to policy makers, and these models are continually updated and improved as new questions are posed. The implementation of testing strategies in high risk settings in Australia was supported using models to explore the effects of test frequency and sensitivity on outbreak detection. An exponential growth model is firstly used to demonstrate how outbreak detection changes with varying growth rate, test frequency and sensitivity. From this model we see that low sensitivity tests can be compensated for by high frequency testing. This model is then updated to an Agent Based Model, which was used to test the robustness of the results from the exponential model, and to extend it to include intermittent workplace scheduling. These models help our fundamental understanding of disease detectability through routine surveillance in workplaces and evaluate the impact of testing strategies and workplace characteristics on the effectiveness of surveillance. This analysis highlights the risks of particular work patterns while also identifying key testing strategies to best improve outbreak detection in high risk workplaces.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing Office of Health Protection.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The emergence of highly immune-escape Omicron variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as BQ and XBB, has led to concerns about the efficacy of vaccines. Using lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralizing assay, we showed that heterologous vaccination involving parental mRNA vaccine as a booster or second booster in individuals that received two or three doses of inactivated vaccines strongly augments the neutralizing activity against emerging Omicron subvariants, including BF.7, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1, by 4.3-to 219-folds. Therefore, a heterologous boosting strategy with mRNA-based vaccines should be considered in populations where inactivated vaccines were primarily used.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by The European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (ATAC, 101003650, D.F.R., M.H., L.H., H.M., Q.P.H), the Center for Innovative Medicine at the Karolinska Institutet (FoUI-963219, Q.P.H), the Swedish Research Council (2019-01302, 2020-06116, Q.P.H), the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW2020.0102, L.H., Q.P.H), and the Magnus Bergvalls Stiftelse (2022-111, F.Z).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the ethics committees in institutional review board (IRB) of Stockholm, and the Tehran University of Medical Sciences.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%T A pattern shift in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant transmission after the city lockdown--observational study based upon daily reported addresses of infected cases

%X Background Varied degrees of lockdown have been imposed for dozens of jurisdictions upon facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics during the past two years. Areal lockdown has been demonstrated effective to reduce the morbility and mortality of COVID-19. Even after the strict lockdown the peak of infection will appear around 9-25 days (median 18 days) thereafter. A wave of Omicron variant (BA.2 and BA.2.2) outbreak was seen from March to May 2022, in Shanghai, a megacity in China mainland. Aim To understand the sources of infection cases from outside or inside the isolated locations before and after the strict city lockdown.Methods The attributable addresses of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported daily as well as the infected cases from March 18th, 2022 on through government website, which was publicly accessible. The address data and infected cases were collected until May 29th, 2022. The location (longitude and latitude) of these addresses were retrieved and the pattern of repeatedly reported addresses were analyzed. A tool of simple and meso-scale point-based (location-based) chronological graph was used to visualize and analyze the interactions of these locations.Results From March 18th to May 29th 2022, 173,350 items representing 35,743 unique addresses and 636,279 infected cases were released. The infection cases peaked 16 days after the city lockdown and were highly clustered in much crowded districts. The proportion of repeatedly reported locations of the previous day increased from around 20% before lockdown to greater than 40% in the plateau and remained at this level for up to one third (20/62) of the lockdown phase. This significantly increased proportion of intra-address infection indicated a pattern shift from inter-addresses to intra-address (D=0.2954, p&lt;0.0001), which might perpetuate to the growth of infection cases. Based upon the day-to-day nearest neighbour transmission assumption the connections between some frequently repeated locations might be complex and heterogeneous.Interpretation During the strict areal isolation the intra-address infection may contribute significantly to infected cases of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, the infection might have easily spilled over the boundary of family(with averaged family size of 2.3-3.1 people and family were required stay-at-home compulsively). This significant inter-addresses to intra-address pattern shift necessitated the understanding of intra-location transmission routes and corresponding interventions. Areal isolation and close off with homogeneous assumption inside and outside the isolated areas should be modified and the quantifing of the elevated risk for previously less exposed but much vulnerable sub-population was in pressing need.Research in context Evidence before this study It is commonly observable that the infection cases will continue to increase and peaked in several weeks after the first day of imposing areal lockdown. The search syntax of [(SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19) AND (transmission OR infection) AND (post-lockdown OR “during lockdown” OR “isolated area*”)] on PubMed hits 1372 records(on 2022-08-10). However, the viral transmission between the isolated locations or within them have not been studied thoroughly, maybe, due to the presumption that it would be stopped eventually by greatly reducing the inter-personal contact.The search syntax of [(SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19) AND (transmission OR infection) AND (post-lockdown OR “during lockdown” OR “isolated area*”) AND (strict)] on PubMed hits 57 records. The populations of different ages with heterogeneous risks of exposure to viruses have been revealed.Added values in this study The strict city lockdown of Shanghai in facing the Omicron outbreak provided a prototype to understand the sources of infection by using the daily reported address (isolated immediately) involving infected cases. A noticeable pattern shift was revealed in this study with significantly increased proportion of intra-location (small area) self-propagation after the city lockdown.Implication of all the available evidence Counter measures should be provided to reduce the risk of transmmision within the small isolated areas; and the elevated risk for the much vulnerable sub-populations within the intra-location (small isolated areas) should be quantified and to trade off between the reduced inter-location risk and increased intra-location risk of infection in policy making.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:https://wsjkw.sh.gov.cn/xwfb/index.html https://wsjkw.sh.gov.cn/xwfb/20220319/dc5938b3d12d4d86be7470ae03beac1c.htmlI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) infected, asymptomatic individuals are an important contributor to COVID transmission. CoV2-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)—as generated by the immune system following infection or vaccination—has helped limit CoV2 transmission from asymptomatic individuals to susceptible populations (e.g. elderly). Here, we describe the relationships between COVID incidence and CoV2 lineage, viral load, saliva Ig levels (CoV2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG) and inhibitory capacity in asymptomatic individuals between Jan 2021 and May 2022. These data were generated as part of a large university COVID monitoring program and demonstrate that COVID incidence among asymptomatic individuals occurred in waves which mirrored those in surrounding regions, with saliva CoV2 viral loads becoming progressively higher in our community until vaccine mandates were established. Among the unvaccinated, infection with each CoV2 lineage (pre-Omicron) resulted in saliva Spike-specific IgM, IgA and IgG responses, the latter increasing significantly post-infection and being more pronounced than N-specific IgG responses. Vaccination resulted in significantly higher Spike-specific IgG levels compared to unvaccinated infected individuals, and uninfected vaccinees’ saliva was more capable of inhibiting Spike function. Vaccinees with breakthrough Delta infections had Spike-specific IgG levels comparable to those of uninfected vaccinees; however, their ability to inhibit Spike binding was diminished. These data demonstrate that COVID vaccines achieved hoped-for effects in our community, including the generation of mucosal antibodies that inhibit Spike and lower community viral loads, and suggest breakthrough Delta infections were not due to an absence of vaccine-elicited Ig, but instead limited Spike binding activity in the face of high community viral loads.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by The Ohio State UniversityAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This work was reviewed and approved by The Ohio State University Biomedical Sciences Institutional Review Board (ID #2021H0080).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The dynamics of innate and adaptive immunity to infection in infants remain obscure. Here, we used a multi-omics approach to perform a longitudinal analysis of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants and young children in the first weeks and months of life by analyzing blood samples collected before, during, and after infection with Omicron and Non-Omicron variants. Infection stimulated robust antibody titers that, unlike in adults, were stably maintained for &gt;300 days. Antigen-specific memory B cell (MCB) responses were durable for 150 days but waned thereafter. Somatic hypermutation of V-genes in MCB accumulated progressively over 9 months. The innate response was characterized by upregulation of activation markers on blood innate cells, and a plasma cytokine profile distinct from that seen in adults, with no inflammatory cytokines, but an early and transient accumulation of chemokines (CXCL10, IL8, IL-18R1, CSF-1, CX3CL1), and type I IFN. The latter was strongly correlated with viral load, and expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in myeloid cells measured by single-cell transcriptomics. Consistent with this, single-cell ATAC-seq revealed enhanced accessibility of chromatic loci targeted by interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and reduced accessibility of AP-1 targeted loci, as well as traces of epigenetic imprinting in monocytes, during convalescence. Together, these data provide the first snapshot of immunity to infection during the initial weeks and months of life.Competing Interest StatementAlessandro Sette is a consultant for Gritstone Bio, Flow Pharma, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Qiagen, Fortress, Gilead, Sanofi, Merck, RiverVest, MedaCorp, Turnstone, NA Vaccine Institute, Emervax, Gerson Lehrman Group and Guggenheim.

%X Background Risk of short- and long-term all-cause mortality after a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is inadequately understood.Methods A national, matched, retrospective cohort study was conducted in Qatar to assess the risk of all-cause mortality in the national cohort of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with a reference national control cohort of uninfected persons. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models.Results Among unvaccinated persons, within 90 days after primary infection, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) comparing incidence of death in the primary-infection cohort with the infection-naïve cohort was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.02-1.39). The aHR was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.11-1.63) in persons more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.72-1.24) in those less clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. In subsequent follow-up, the aHR was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.37-0.68). The aHR was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.28-0.58) in months 3-7 after the primary infection and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.46-1.26) in subsequent months. The aHR was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25-0.54) in persons more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.48-1.24) in those less clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Among vaccinated persons, no evidence was found for differences in incidence of death in the primary-infection versus infection-naïve cohorts, even among persons more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.Conclusions COVID-19 mortality in Qatar appears primarily driven by forward displacement of deaths of individuals with relatively short life expectancy and more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Vaccination negated the mortality displacement by preventing early deaths.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors are grateful for institutional salary support from the Biomedical Research Program and the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Biomathematics Research Core, both at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, as well as for institutional salary support provided by the Ministry of Public Health, Hamad Medical Corporation, and Sidra Medicine.

%X Pronounced immune escape by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has resulted in large numbers of individuals with hybrid immunity, generated through a combination of vaccination and infection. Based primarily on circulating neutralizing antibody (NAb) data, concerns have been raised that omicron breakthrough infections in triple-vaccinated individuals result in poor induction of omicron-specific immunity, and that a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 in particular is associated with profound immune dampening. Taking a broader and comprehensive approach, we characterized mucosal and blood immunity to both spike and non-spike antigens following BA.1/BA.2 infections in triple mRNA-vaccinated individuals, with and without a history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that the majority of individuals increase BA.1/BA.2/BA.5-specific NAb following infection, but confirm that the magnitude of increase and post-omicron titres are indeed higher in those who were infection-naive. In contrast, significant increases in nasal antibody responses are seen regardless of prior infection history, including neutralizing activity against BA.5 spike. Spike-specific T cells increase only in infection-naive vaccinees; however, post-omicron T cell responses are still significantly higher in previously-infected individuals, who appear to have maximally induced responses with a CD8+ phenotype of high cytotoxic potential after their 3rd mRNA vaccine dose. Antibody and T cell responses to non-spike antigens also increase significantly regardless of prior infection status, with a boost seen in previously-infected individuals to immunity primed by their first infection. These findings suggest that hybrid immunity induced by omicron breakthrough infections is highly dynamic, complex, and compartmentalised, with significant immune enhancement that can help protect against COVID-19 caused by future omicron variants.Competing Interest StatementSusanna J Dunachie is a Scientific Advisor to the Scottish Parliament on COVID-19 for which she receives a fee.

%X The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is still producing hundreds of thousands of cases worldwide. However, the currently dominant Omicron variant (and its sub-variants) have proven to be less virulent than previous dominant variants, resulting in proportionately fewer severe cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Nonetheless, a persistent concern is that new mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may yet produce more virulent variants. In the present study we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that this is unlikely, and that COVID-19 will remain a low-severity although highly transmissible disease. Three complementary pieces of evidence support our argument. First, empirical observations suggest that the transmission advantage that Omicron (sub)variants enjoy is in large part due to their cell tropism in the upper respiratory tract, which renders them less virulent. Second, when a negative link between transmissibility and virulence is included in agent-based epidemiological models, viruses evolve towards lower virulence. Third, genetic diversification of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that epistasis in the Omicron family reduces the diversity of successful variants. Taken together these observations point to a high likelihood that the severity of COVID-19 will remain sufficiently low for an endemic status to be reached, provided that vaccination campaigns and sensible hygiene and social measures continue worldwide, as suggested by the World Health Organization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was received partial financial support from project UNAM-PAPIIT-IA103121.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The protection afforded by vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to individuals with chronic lung disease is not well established. To understand how chronic lung disease impacts SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-elicited immunity we performed deep immunophenotyping of the humoral and cell mediated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response in an investigative cohort of vaccinated patients with diverse pulmonary conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Compared to healthy controls, 48% of vaccinated patients with chronic lung diseases had reduced antibody titers to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigen as early as 3-4 months after vaccination, correlating with decreased vaccine-specific memory B cells. Vaccine-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were also significantly reduced in patients with asthma, COPD, and a subset of ILD patients compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal the complex nature of vaccine-elicited immunity in high-risk patients with chronic lung disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the following funding: National Institutes of Health Grants: R.L.R.

%X We present an analysis of epidemiological compartment models that explicitly capture the dynamics of asymptomatic but infectious individuals. Our models can be viewed as an extension to classic SIR models, to which a distinct Asymptomatic compartment is added. We discuss both a group compartment model capturing a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SAIRS) epidemic process, and also introduce and evaluate SAIRS dynamics evolving over networks. We investigate equilibria and stability properties that include both disease-free and endemic equilibria states for these models, providing sufficient conditions for convergence to these equilibria. Model parameter estimation results based on local test-site and Peoria county clinic data are given, and a number of simulations illustrating the effects of asymptomatic-infected individuals and network structure on the spread and/or persistence of the disease are presented.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was partially funded by NSF Grant ECS 20-32321 and a research gift grant from C3.ai.

%X Quantifying neutralising capacity of circulating SARS-COV-2 antibodies is critical in evaluating protective humoral immune responses generated post-infection/post-vaccination. Here we describe a novel medium-throughput flow cytometry-based micro-neutralisation test to evaluate Neutralising Antibody (NAb) responses against live SARS-CoV-2 Wild Type and Variants of Concern (VOC) in convalescent/vaccinated populations. Flow Cytometry-Based Micro-Neutralisation Test (Micro-NT) was performed in 96-well plates using clinical isolates WT-B, WT-B.177.18 and/or VOCs Beta and Omicron. Plasma samples (All Ireland Infectious Diseases (AIID) Cohort) were serially diluted (8 points, half-log) from 1/20 and pre-incubated with SARS-CoV-2 (1h, 37°C). Virus-plasma mixture were added onto VERO E6/VERO E6 TMPRSS2 cells for 18h. Percentage infected cells was analysed by automated flow cytometry following trypsinisation, fixation and SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein intracellular staining. Half-maximal Neutralisation Titres (NT50) were determined using four-parameter logistic regression. Our assay was compared to Plaque Reduction Neutralisation Test (PRNT) and validated against WHO anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin Standards. Using WHO Standards with low, medium or high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, both Micro-NT and PRNT achieved comparable NT50 values. Micro-NT was found to be highly reproducible (inter-assay CV of 11.64%). Screening 190 convalescent samples and 11 COVID-19 naive controls (AIID cohort) we demonstrated that Micro-NT has broad dynamic range differentiating NT50s &lt;1/20 to &gt;1/5000. We could also characterise immune-escape VOC observing up to 10-fold reduction in NT50 against SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. Our flow cytometry-based Micro-NT is a robust and reliable assay to quantify NAb titres, and has been selected as an endpoint in clinical trials. It has higher throughput (96 well format versus 12 well) and reduced infection time (18h vs 48-96h) compared to the gold standard PRNT.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSOR is the recipient of the Irish Research Council (IRC) Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship (GOIPG/2019/4432).

%X Objectives We aimed to evaluate the association between the humoral and cellular immune responses and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with Delta or Omicron BA.1 variants in fully vaccinated outpatients.Methods Anti-RBD IgG levels and IFN-γ release were evaluated at PCR-diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in 636 samples from negative and positive patients during Delta and Omicron BA.1 periods.Results Median levels of anti-RBD IgG in positive patients were significantly lower than in negative patients for both variants (p &lt; 0.05). The risk of Delta infection was inversely correlated with anti-RBD IgG titres (aOR = 0.63, 95% CI [0.41; 0.95], p = 0.03) and it was lower in the hybrid immunity group compared to the homologous vaccination group (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI [0.05; 0.62], p = 0.01). In contrast, neither the vaccination scheme nor anti-RBD IgG titers were associated with the risk of BA.1 infection in multivariable analysis. IFN-γ release post-SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation was not different between samples from patients infected (either with Delta or Omicron BA.1 variant) or not (p = 0.77).Conclusions Our results show that high circulating levels of anti-RBD IgG and hybrid immunity were independently associated with a lower risk of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in outpatients with differences according to the infecting variant.Competing Interest StatementK.B.-P. and L.G. are bioMerieux employees.

%X Current approved COVID-19 vaccines, notably mRNA and adenoviral vectored technologies, still fail to fully protect against infection and transmission of various SARS-CoV-2 variants. The mucosal immunity at the upper respiratory tract represents the first line of defense against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and is thus critical to develop vaccine blocking human-to-human transmission. We measured systemic and mucosal Immunoglobulin A (IgA) response in serum and saliva from 133 healthcare workers from Percy teaching military hospital following a mild infection (SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain, n=58) or not infected (n=75), and after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (Vaxzevria®/Astrazeneca and/or Comirnaty®/Pfizer). While serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgA response lasted up to 16 months post-infection, IgA response in saliva had mostly fallen to baseline level at 6 months post-infection. Vaccination could reactivate the mucosal response generated by prior infection, but failed to induce a significant mucosal IgA response by itself. As breakthrough infections have been correlated with IgA levels, other vaccine platforms inducing a better mucosal immunity are needed to control COVID-19 infection in the future. Early post-COVID-19 serum anti-Spike-NTD IgA titer correlated with seroneutralization titers. Interestingly, its saliva counterpart positively correlated with persistent smell and taste disorders more than one year after mild COVID-19, and could potentially be used as an early prognosis biomarker.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Service de Sante des Armees, and the Agence Innovation Defense (projet ONADAP).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval of the cohort study Immuno-Covid Percy was given by the Comite de Protection des Personnes Ile de France VIII engaged in clinical research (92100 Boulogne-Billancourt, France, CPP 20 05 25) and was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04408001).

%X Background The optimal isolation duration for COVID-19 patients remains unclear. To support an update of WHO Living Clinical management guidelines for COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2022.2), this rapid systematic review and modelling study addresses the effects of different isolation periods for preventing onward transmission leading to hospitalization and death among secondary cases.Methods We searched World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database for clinical studies evaluating the impact of isolation periods for COVID-19 patients up to July 28, 2022. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to summarize testing rates of persistent test positivity rates after COVID-19 infection. We developed a model to compare the effects of the five-day isolation and removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test with ten-day isolation on onward transmission leading to hospitalization and death. We assumed that patients with a positive test are infectious and those with a negative test are not. If the test becomes negative, patients will stay negative. The model included estimates of test positivity rates, effective reproduction number, and hospitalization rate or case fatality rate.Findings Twelve studies addressing persistent test positivity rates including 2799 patients proved eligible. Asymptomatic patients (27.1%, 95% CI: 15.8% to 40.0%) had a significantly lower rapid antigen test (RAT) positive rate than symptomatic patients (68.1%, 95% CI: 40.6% to 90.3%) on day 5. The RAT positive rate was 21.5% (95% CI: 0 to 64.1%; moderate certainty) on day 10. Our modelling study suggested that the risk difference (RD) for asymptomatic patients between five-day isolation and ten-day isolation in hospitalization (2 more hospitalizations of secondary cases per 1000 patients isolated, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 2 more to 3 more) and mortality (1 more per 1000 patients, 95% UI 0 to 1 more) of secondary cases proved very small (very low certainty). For symptomatic patients, the potential impact of five- versus ten-day isolation was much greater in hospitalizations (RD 19 more per 1000 patients, 95% UI 14 more to 24 more; very low certainty) and mortality (RD 5 more per 1000 patients, 95% UI 4 more to 6 more; very low certainty). There may be no difference between removing isolation based on a negative antigen test and ten-day isolation in the onward transmission leading to hospitalization or death, but the average isolation period (mean difference −3 days) will be shorter for the removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test (moderate certainty).Interpretation Five versus 10 days of isolation in asymptomatic patients may result in a small amount of onward transmission and negligible hospitalization and mortality, but in symptomatic patients concerning transmission and resulting hospitalization and mortality. The evidence is, however, very uncertain.Funding WHO.Evidence before this study Isolating infected patients and quarantining individuals with a high risk of recent infection remain widely used strategies to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. There are no prior systematic reviews to evaluate effects relevant to decisions regarding protocols for ending COVID-19 isolation. Many modelling studies have, however, evaluated impact of five days of isolation or alternative strategies (e.g. 7 days and 10 days) with or without one negative lateral flow device on secondary infections or additional transmission risk. However, none has focused on the most patient-important outcomes - onward transmission leading to hospitalization or death. The optimal isolation duration for COVID-19 patients remains unclear. We searched WHO COVID-19 database for clinical studies evaluating the impact of isolation periods for COVID-19 patients up to July 28, 2022. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to summarize testing rates of persistent test positivity rates after COVID-19 infection. We used a model to compare the effects of the five-day isolation and removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test with ten-day isolation on onward transmission leading to hospitalization and death.Added value of this study To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and modelling study to compare effects of the five-day isolation and removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test with ten-day isolation on most patient-important outcomes - onward transmission leading to hospitalization or death. This study demonstrates that for symptomatic patients the five-day isolation may increase onward transmission and thus hospitalization and mortality of secondary cases compared with the ten-day isolation by a magnitude most would consider important. For asymptomatic patients, the increase in hospitalizations and death may be small enough to be considered unimportant. Removal of isolation based on a negative antigen test will probably shorten the average isolation period compared with isolating all patients for 10 days.Implications of all the available evidence Our study provides evidence that 5 versus 10 days of isolation in asymptomatic patients may result in a small amount of onward transmission and negligible hospitalization and mortality, but in symptomatic patients concerning transmission and resulting hospitalization and mortality.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by WHO.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background In view of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 immune escape variants and evidence of waning immunity, new immunisation strategies and variant-adapted vaccines are needed. Based on preclinical proof of concept studies and requirement of variant-adapted and booster vaccines, the Gamma Variant RBD-based ARVAC-CG vaccine was selected for a first clinical trial in humans.Methods Eighty participants (healthy adults, 18-55 years-old) were sequentially assigned to receive two (28 days apart) intramuscular doses of 25-μg (n=60) or 50-μg (n=20) of a Gamma RBD-based subunit vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide. The primary endpoint was safety. The secondary objective was to describe the neutralising antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 Ancestral strain and several variants of concern (Gamma, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.5) measured by a live virus-based neutralisation assay. Cellular immune responses were studied as an exploratory objective by an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05656508).Findings The interim results from the ongoing phase 1 study are described. ARVAC-CG exhibited a satisfactory safety profile, a robust and broad booster response of neutralising antibodies against the Ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, the Gamma variant, and other VOCs (Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.5) and a booster effect on T cell immunity.Interpretation ARVAC-CG is safe and highly immunogenic when used as booster in individuals previously immunised with different COVID-19 vaccine platforms. These results warrant further clinical evaluation of this vaccine candidate for boosting other COVID-19 vaccines.Funding Laboratorio Pablo Cassará S.R.L. (Argentina).Evidence before this study Next-generation COVID-19 vaccines are based on a variant-adapted approach, using a strain other than the parental strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan or D614G strain). It has been suggested that the use of vaccines containing Beta spike protein may be an interesting strategy to acquire wider protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. The Beta variant has been tested as booster in different monovalent or bivalent vaccine platforms. Indeed, Sanofi and GSK VidPrevtyn® Beta has recently been approved in Europe representing the first protein-based next-generation COVID-19 booster vaccine. While the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of Gamma and Beta SARS-CoV-2 variants are very similar, no clinical data on Gamma variant-based COVID-19 vaccines has been published so far. Preclinical data in mice indicate that the Gamma variant-based vaccine is more immunogenic and induces a broader nAb response than the ancestral RBD-based vaccine.Added value of this study To our knowledge, these is the first clinical trial reported from any monovalent Gamma variant RBD protein adjuvanted vaccine used as heterologous booster of different primary series vaccine platforms. Two different vaccine doses were tested, and both exhibited a good profile of safety, tolerability and reactogenicity. ARVAC-CG as a single heterologous booster induced a significant increase of broad-spectrum neutralising antibodies against Ancestral, Gamma, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.5 variants of concern (VOCs), binding antibodies, and IFN-γ producing cells. All these immune responses were significantly boosted in individuals primed with vaccines from different platforms. Plasma from vaccinees receiving a heterologous booster with ARVAC-CG was superior to plasma from BTN16b2 boosted individuals in neutralising Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.Implications of all the available evidence Here, we present the available data from the phase I study of ARVAC-CG vaccine, involving healthy adults who had previously received a complete primary vaccination schedule with a COVID-19 vaccine.The positive safety and immunogenicity results of the ARVAC-CG vaccine candidate presented here justify further evaluation of its immunogenicity against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in a comprehensive Phase 2/3 trial. Further research is required to assess the antibody persistence over time after a booster dose of ARVAC-CG.Competing Interest StatementDeclaration of interests JMR, LPC R&amp;D and CMC Group, FMO, JCV are employees of Laboratorio Pablo Cassara S.R.L., which developed the vaccine and funded the trial.

%X Purpose COViK - a prospective hospital-based multicenter case-control study in Germany - aims to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against severe disease. Here, we report vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-caused hospitalization and intensive care treatment during the Omicron wave.Methods We analyzed data from 276 cases with COVID-19 and 494 control patients recruited in 13 hospitals from 1 December 2021 to 5 September 2022. We calculated crude and confounder-adjusted VE estimates.Results 21% of cases (57/276) were not vaccinated, compared to 5% of controls (26/494; p &lt; 0.001). Confounder-adjusted VE against COVID-19-caused hospitalization was 55.4% (95% CI: 12-78%), 81.5% (95% CI: 68-90%) and 95.6% (95%CI: 88-99%) after two, three and four vaccine doses, respectively. VE against hospitalization due to COVID-19 remained stable up to one year after three vaccine doses.Conclusion Three vaccine doses remained highly effective in preventing severe disease and this protection was sustained; a fourth dose further increased protection.Ethical review and trial registration The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charité Universitätsmedizin, Berlin (EA1/063/21) and was registered at “Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien” (DRKS00025004).Potential conflicts of interest S.

%X Widespread use of over-the-counter rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 has led to a decrease in availability of clinical samples for viral genomic surveillance. As an alternative sample source, we evaluated RNA isolated from BinaxNOW swabs stored at ambient temperature for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and full viral genome sequencing. 81 of 103 samples (78.6%) yielded detectable RNA, and 46 of 57 samples (80.7 %) yielded complete genome sequences.

%X We have developed a CRISPR based assay that can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in RNA extracted from human samples and also predict if it is an Omicron or non-Omicron variant of the virus. This is a nucleic acid amplification-based test (NAAT). The amplification and detection are carried out in two independent steps in this assay. Amplification is done using a standard one-step RT-PCR method. The detection is done using a method that utilizes the trans-cleavage activity of the Cas12a enzyme. We have evaluated the performance of OmiCrisp in more than 80 clinical samples and observed an agreement of 100% with the sequencing results, in labeling SARS-CoV-2 positive samples as Omicron or non-Omicron. OmiCrisp -like platform can be developed quickly and can potentially complement sequencing for quick and rapid tracking of the transmission of new pathogen variants.Competing Interest StatementAuthors are employees of CrisprBits Private Limited and may hold shares in the companyFunding StatementThe study was internally funded at CrisprBits.

%X Background As there are limited data on B cell epitopes for the nucleocapsid protein in SARS-CoV-2, we sought to identify the immunodominant regions within the N protein, recognized by patients with varying severity of natural infection with the Wuhan strain (WT), delta, omicron and in those who received the Sinopharm vaccines, which is an inactivated, whole virus vaccine.Methods Using overlapping peptides representing the N protein, with an in-house ELISA, we mapped the immunodominant regions within the N protein, in seronegative (n=30), WT infected (n=30), delta infected (n=30), omicron infected+vaccinated (n=20) and Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV) vaccinees (n=30). We then investigated the sensitivity and specificity of these immunodominant regions and analysed their conservation with other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, seasonal human coronaviruses and bat Sarbecoviruses. We then investigated the kinetics of responses to these regions in those with varying severity of acute COVID-19.Results We identified four immunodominant regions aa 29-52, aa 155-178, aa 274 to 297 and aa 365 to 388, were highly conserved within SARS-CoV-2 and the bat coronaviruses. The magnitude of responses to these regions varied based on the infecting SARS-CoV-2 variants, with WT infected individuals predominantly recognizing aa155 to 178 regions, delta infected individuals and vaccinated+omicron infected individuals predominantly recognizing regions aa 29 to 52 and aa 274 to 294 regions. Sinopharm vaccinees recognized all four regions, with the magnitude of responses significantly lower than other groups. &gt;80% of individuals gave responses above the positive cut-off threshold to many of the four regions, with some differences with individuals who were infected with different VoCs. These regions were found to be 100% specific, as none of the seronegative individuals gave any responses.Conclusions N-protein specific responses appear to be detectable in over 90% of those who were naturally infected or vaccinated with a whole virus inactivated vaccine, with responses mainly directed against four regions of the protein, which were highly conserved. As these regions were highly specific with high sensitivity, they have a potential to be used to develop diagnostic assays and to be used in development of vaccines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe are grateful to Allergy Immunology and Cell Biology Unit, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, the NIH, USA (grant number 5U01AI151788-02), World bank, Sri Lanka Covid 19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Project (ERHSP) of Ministry of Health Sri Lanka funded by World Bank and the UK Medical Research Council for funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Blood samples were obtained following informed written consent.

%X Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder that causes debilitating swelling and destruction of the joints. People with RA are treated with drugs that actively suppress one or more parts of their immune system, and these may alter their response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed blood samples from a cohort of RA subjects after receiving a 2-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen. Our data show that individuals on the CTLA4-Ig therapy abatacept have reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies after vaccination. At a cellular level, these subjects show reduced activation and class-switching of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells, as well as reduced numbers and impaired helper cytokine production by SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells. Individuals on methotrexate showed similar but less severe defects in vaccine response, whereas individuals on the B cell-depleting therapy rituximab had a near-total loss of antibody production after vaccination. These data define a specific cellular phenotype associated with impaired response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in RA subjects on different immune-modifying therapies, and help inform efforts to improve vaccination strategies in this vulnerable population.Competing Interest StatementJHB is a Scientific Co-Founder and Scientific Advisory Board member of GentiBio, a consultant for Bristol-Myers Squibb and Hotspot Therapeutics, and has past and current research projects sponsored by Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squib, Janssen, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer.

%X Background There are limited global data on head-to-head comparisons of vaccine platforms assessing both humoral and cellular immune responses, stratified by pre-vaccination serostatus. The COVID-19 vaccination drive for the Indian population in the 18 to 45-year age-group began in April 2021 when seropositivity rates in the general population were rising due to the Delta wave in April-May 2021.Methods Between 30 June 2021 and 28 January 2022, we enrolled 691 participants in the 18-45 age group across 4 clinical sites in India. In this non-randomized and laboratory blinded study, participants received either two doses of Covaxin® 4 weeks apart or two doses of Covishield™ 12 weeks apart per the national vaccination policy. The primary outcome was the seroconversion rate and the geometric mean titer (GMT) of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. The secondary outcome was the frequency of cellular immune responses pre- and post-vaccination.Findings When compared to pre-vaccination baseline, both vaccines elicited statistically significant seroconversion and binding antibody levels in both seronegative and seropositive individuals. In the per-protocol cohort, Covishield™ elicited higher antibody responses than Covaxin® as measured by seroconversion rate (98.3% vs 74.4%, p&lt;0.0001 in seronegative individuals; 91.7% vs 66.9%, p&lt;0.0001 in seropositive individuals) as well as by anti-spike antibody levels against the ancestral strain (GMT 1272.1 vs 75.4 BAU/ml, p&lt;0.0001 in seronegative individuals; 2089.07 vs 585.7 BAU/ml, p&lt;0.0001 in seropositive individuals). Not all sites recruited at the same time, therefore site-specific immunogenicity was impacted by the timing of vaccination relative to the Delta and Omicron waves. Surrogate neutralizing antibody responses against variants-of-concern were higher in Covishield™ recipients than in Covaxin® recipients and in seropositive than in seronegative individuals after both vaccination and asymptomatic Omicron infection. T cell responses are reported from only one of the four site cohorts where the vaccination schedule preceded the Omicron wave. In seronegative individuals, Covishield™ elicited both CD4+ and CD8+ spike-specific cytokine-producing T cells whereas Covaxin® elicited mainly CD4+ spike-specific T cells. Neither vaccine showed significant post-vaccination expansion of spike-specific T cells in seropositive individuals.Interpretation Covishield™ elicited immune responses of higher magnitude and breadth than Covaxin® in both seronegative individuals and seropositive individuals, across cohorts representing the pre-vaccination immune history of the majority of the vaccinated Indian population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialCTRI/2021/09/036258Funding StatementThe project was fully supported by CSR funding from Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and Unilever India Pvt.

%X As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 will be globally important. Official weekly cases have not dropped below 2 million since September of 2020, and continued emergence of novel variants have created a moving target for our immune systems and public health alike. The temporal aspects of COVID-19 immunity, particularly from repeated vaccination and infection, are less well understood than short-term vaccine efficacy. In this study, we explore the impact of combined vaccination and infection, also known as hybrid immunity, and the timing thereof on the quality and quantity of antibodies produced by a cohort of 96 health care workers. We find robust neutralizing antibody responses among those with hybrid immunity against all variants, including Omicron BA.2, and we further found significantly improved neutralizing titers with longer vaccine-infection intervals up to 400 days. These results indicate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses undergo continual maturation following primary exposure by either vaccination or infection for at least 400 days after last antigen exposure. We show that neutralizing antibody responses improved upon secondary boosting with greater impact seen after extended intervals. Our findings may also extend to booster vaccine doses, a critical consideration in future vaccine campaign strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by a grant from the M.

%X European countries are focusing on testing, isolation, and boosting strategies to counter the 2022/2023 winter surge due to Omicron subvariants. However, widespread pandemic fatigue and limited compliance potentially undermine mitigation efforts. To establish a baseline for interventions, we ran a multicountry survey to assess respondents’ willingness to receive booster vaccination and comply with testing and isolation mandates. The vast majority of survey participants (N=4,594) was willing to adhere to testing (&gt;91%) and rapid isolation (&gt;88%) across the three countries. Pronounced differences emerged in the declared senior adherence to booster vaccination (73% in France, 94% in Belgium, 86% in Italy). Next, we inferred the vaccine-induced population immunity profile at the winter start from prior vaccination data, immunity waning, and declared booster uptake. Integrating survey and estimated immunity data in a branching process epidemic spreading model, we evaluated the effectiveness and costs of current protocols in France, Belgium, and Italy to manage the winter wave. Model results estimate that testing and isolation protocols would confer significant benefit in reducing transmission (17-24%) with declared adherence. Achieving a mitigating level similar to the French protocol, the Belgian protocol would require 30% fewer tests and avoid the long isolation periods of the Italian protocol (average of 6 days vs. 11). A cost barrier to test would significantly decrease adherence in France and Belgium, undermining protocols’ effectiveness. Simpler mandates for isolation may increase awareness and actual compliance, reducing testing costs, without compromising mitigation. High booster vaccination uptake remains key for the control of the winter wave.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was partly supported by: Agence Nationale de la Recherche projects COSCREEN (ANR-21-CO16-0005) and DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03) to VC; ANRS-Maladies Infectieuses Émergentes project EMERGEN (ANRS0151) to VC; EU Horizon 2020 grants MOOD (H2020-874850) and RECOVER (H2020-101003589) to VC, EpiPose (101003688) to DP, LH, NH; Horizon Europe VERDI (101045989) to VC, DP; the Chaire Blaise Pascal Program of the Île-de-France region to JSW.

%X BACKGROUND This study has assessed a new Anti-COVID-19 Monoclonal Antibody Nasal Spray (SA58) for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).METHODS We conducted an efficacy study in adults aged 18 years and older within three days of exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual. Recruited participants were randomized in a ratio of 3:1 to receive SA58 or placebo. Primary endpoints were laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 within study period.FINDINGS A total of 1,222 participants were randomized and dosed (SA58, n=901; placebo, n=321). Median of follow-up was 2·25 days and 2·79 days for SA58 and placebo, respectively. Adverse events occurred in 221 of 901 (25%) and 72 of 321 (22%) participants with SA58 and placebo, respectively, with no significant difference (P=0·49). All adverse events were mild in severity. Laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 developed in 7 of 824 participants (0·22 per 100 person-days) in the SA58 group vs 14 of 299 (1·17 per 100 person-days) in the placebo group, resulting in an estimated efficacy of 80 · 82% (95%CI 52 · 41%-92 · 27%). There were 32 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positives (1·04 per 100 person-days) in the SA58 group vs 32 (2·80 per 100 person-days) in the placebo group, resulting in an estimated efficacy of 61·83% (95%CI 37· 50%-76· 69%). A total of 21 RT-PCR positive samples were sequenced. 21 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants were identified, and all were the Omicron variant BF·7.INTERPRETATION SA58 Nasal Spray showed favorable efficacy and safety in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic COVID-19 in healthy adult workers who had exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within 72 hours.FUNDING No funding was received for this study.Evidence before this study Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with mAbs represent a very important public health strategy against COVID-19 outbreak. SA58 Nasal Spray is a broad-spectrum anti-COVID-19 mAb, developed by Sinovac Life Sciences Ltd. for treatment and prophylaxis against COVID-19. SA58 has been shown to potently neutralize ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses, including most of circulating Omicron variants. We searched PubMed on Nov 21, 2022, for published clinical trials, with no language or date restrictions, using various combinations of the search terms of “monoclonal antibodies”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “prophylaxis”, and “prevention”. Three published trials were identified. The first study reported the efficacy of AZD7442 (tixagevimab/cilgavimab) PEP against symptomatic COVID-19 in adults aged ≥18 years over a 183-day follow-up period. The primary efficacy end point of post-exposure prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 was not met, though AZD7442 showed promising results in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative at baseline. The second study reported the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab for COVID-19 prevention in household contacts of individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high-risk transmission setting over a one-month efficacy assessment period. The third study reported REGEN-COV (casirivimab/imdevimab) for preventing symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously uninfected household contacts of infected persons. Both bamlanivimab and REGEN-COV showed satisfactory safety profile and efficacy against COVID-19 and were licensed for PEP use in the U.S. However, due to the circulating Omicron variants have developed significant escape properties, the emergency use authorization of bamlanivimab and REGEN-COV for treatment and PEP against COVID-19 has been discontinued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Till the end of December 2022, no drug was available for PEP use against COVID-19.Added value of this study During a recent large outbreak of the Omicron BF·7 sublineage in Beijing, our preliminary results in healthy adults within 72 hours of contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals showed that SA58 nasal spray was highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the sublineage, which variants have shown significant escape of immunity in previous studies. SA58 was able to significantly lower the risk of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by 80·82% (95%CI 52·41%-92·27%) and of SARS-CoV-2 infection by 61·83% (95%CI 37·50%-76·69%) in our study participants.Implications of all the available evidence This trial showed the ability of a nasal spray of broad-spectrum anti-COVID-19 mAb SA58 to provide satisfactory protection against one circulating Omicron strain of SARS-CoV-2. The drug had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated by healthy adults. This newly developed mAb is resistant to SARS-CoV-2 mutations and may provide a new powerful countermeasure to tackle against the immunity-escaping variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the population. The intranasal administration of SA58 is novel and has many advantages over intramuscular injections of mAbs previously licensed, as it is less invasive and more acceptable in recipients. Auto-administration with easiness of use may allow early administration, probably a key feature for prevention.Competing Interest StatementXiaoliang Xie and Yunlong Cao are the inventors of the provisional patent applications for the anti-COVID-19 monoclonal antibody (SA58).

%X Background Vaccines developed against Covid-19 infection were effective in controlling symptomatic infections and hospitalizations. However, waning immunity was reported within 6 months of primary vaccination series. Due to waning of SARS-CoV-2 specific primary immunity, protection towards emerging variants of concern (VoC) was low. To rejuvenate the immunogenicity of vaccines, a third or booster dose was highly recommended by many state governments. In this regard, several clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the homologous or heterologous booster dose effectiveness against VoCs and showed that heterologous immune boosting more effective in controlling breakthrough infections. In this study, we studied the safety and immunogenicity of Biological-E’s CORBEVAX™ vaccine in adult population as a heterologous booster dose.Methods This is a prospective phase-3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study evaluating safety, reactogenicity, tolerability and immunogenicity of CORBEVAX™ vaccine as a heterologous booster dose administered to adult volunteers previously vaccinated with two doses of either COVISHIELD™ or COVAXIN at least 6 months ago. Subjects were RT-PCR negative to SARS-CoV-2 prior to enrolment. A total of 416 subjects between 18 to 80 years of age, were enrolled in to one of the two treatment (COVISHIELD™ or COVAXIN primed subjects) groups (n=208/group) for safety and immunogenicity assessment. Within each group (n=208), subjects were randomized to receive CORBEVAX™ vaccine or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.Findings The safety profile of CORBEVAX™ vaccine administered as booster dose is comparable to the placebo-control group. All the reported adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in their intensity. There was no grade 3 or serious or AEs of special interest (AESI) reported during the study period and all the reported AEs resolved without any sequelae. CORBEVAX™ booster dose administration resulted in significant increase in humoral immune response (nAb titers and Anti-RBD IgG concentration) that was much superior to the placebo in both COVISHIELD™ and COVAXIN recipient arms. Significant increase in nAb titers against Omicron VOC as well as cellular immune response was also observed post CORBEVAX™ booster dose administration.Interpretations Enhancement of immune response coupled with excellent safety profile of the CORBEVAX™ booster dose demonstrates significant benefit of giving CORBEVAX™ heterologous booster dose to subjects that have received COVISHIELD™ or COVAXIN primary vaccination; as early as 6 months post second dose of primary vaccination.The study was prospectively registered with clinical trial registry of India-CTRI/2022/01/039366Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialCTRI/2022/01/039366Funding StatementBIRAC-division of Department-of-Biotechnology, Government-of-India, and Coalition-for-Epidemic-Preparedness-Innovations funded the study.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:1.

%X Determining SARS-CoV-2 immunity is critical to assess COVID-19 risk and the need for prevention and mitigation strategies. We measured SARS-CoV-2 Spike/Nucleocapsid seroprevalence and serum neutralizing activity against Wu01, BA.4/5 and BQ.1.1 in 1,411 individuals who received medical treatment in five emergency departments in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We detected Spike-IgG in 95.6%, Nucleocapsid-IgG in 24.0% and neutralization against Wu01, BA.4/5 and BQ.1.1 in 94.4%, 85.0%, and 73.8% of participants, respectively. Neutralization against BA.4/5 and BQ.1.1 was reduced 5.6- and 23.4-fold compared to Wu01. Accuracy of S-IgG detection for determination of neutralizing activity against BQ.1.1 was reduced substantially. Furthermore, we explored previous vaccinations and infections as most important correlates of improved BQ.1.1 neutralization using multivariable and Bayesian network analyses. Given an adherence to COVID-19 vaccination recommendations of only 67.7% of all participants, we highlight the need for improvement of vaccine-uptake to reduce the COVID-19 risk in upcoming infection-waves with immune evasive variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding was provided by the ministry for work, health, and social affairs of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (CPS-1-1F).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All samples and data were obtained under protocols approved by the ethics committees of the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne (22_1262), of the Medical Faculty of the University of Bonn (314/22), of the Medical Faculty of the University of Duesseldorf (2022-2072), of the Medical Faculty of the University of Essen (22-10838-BO), and of the Medical Faculty of the University of Muenster (2022-490-b-S).

%X Background The United States (US) authorized the second COVID-19 booster for individuals aged 50+ years on March 29, 2022. To date, the cost-effectiveness of the second booster strategy remains unassessed.Methods We developed a decision-analytic SEIR-Markov model by five age groups (0-4yrs, 5-11yrs 12-17yrs, 18-49yrs, and 50+yrs) and calibrated the model by actual mortality in each age group in the US. We conducted fives scenarios to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the second booster strategy and incremental benefits if the strategy would expand to 18-49yrs and 12-17yrs, from a healthcare system perspective.Findings Implementing the second booster strategy for those aged 50+yrs would cost $807 million but reduce direct medical costs by $1,128 million, corresponding to a benefit-cost ratio of 1.40. Moreover, the strategy would also result in a gain of 1,048 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) during the 180 days, indicating it was cost-saving. Further, vaccinating individuals aged 18-49yrs with the second booster would result in an additional gain of $1,566 million and 2,276 QALYs. Similarly, expanding vaccination to individuals aged 12-17yrs would result in an additional gain of $15 million and 89 QALYs. However, if social interaction between all age groups was severed, vaccination expansion to 18-49yrs and 12-17yrs would no longer be cost-effective.Interpretation The second booster strategy was likely to be cost-effective in reducing the disease burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding the second booster strategy to 18-49yrs and 12-17yrs would remain cost-effective due to their social contacts with the older age group.Funding World Health OrganizationCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementLZ is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 81950410639), Outstanding Young Scholars Funding (Grant number: 3111500001), Xi'an Jiaotong University Basic Research and Profession Grant (Grant number: xtr022019003 and xzy032020032), and Xi'an Jiaotong University Young Talent Support Grant (Grant number: YX6J004).

%X In patients with common variable immune deficiencies, primary vaccination followed by two booster doses is recommended for protection against COVID-19. Seroconversion has been shown in 60% of patients. We have no information on whether serum antibodies reflect the generation of durable immune memory.In a longitudinal study on 47 common variable immune deficiencies patients who received the third and fourth vaccine dose, we show that the measurement of specific antibodies is not sufficient to predict the establishment of immune memory and the ability to respond to antigen re-exposure.Our results indicate that the combination of antibodies and memory B cells responses represents a more reliable read-out of vaccine immune efficacy in vulnerable patients.This analysis may not only identify individuals remaining unprotected after vaccination and unable to respond to additional booster doses, but also address the search for the underlying immune defect and suggest patient-tailored management strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was supported by funding of the Italian Ministry of Health COVID2020-12371817 and by Grant 5 per mille, 2021.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Sapienza University of Rome (Prot. 0521/2020, July 13, 2020) and performed in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, and the most recent version of the Declaration of HelsinkiI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Since its identification, the novel coronavirus “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 “(SARS-CoV-2) In in late 2019 AT Wuhan, China, by the World Health Organization (WHO), which cause the coronavirus disease 2019, is rapidly spreading, resulting in the global pandemic. As of 19 December 2022, more than 64 million confirmed cases and 6,645,812 deaths have been reported across the world. Over time, the SARS-CoV-2 acquired genetic mutations resulting in multiple types of SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants that have been confirmed. The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was identified later in November 2021, with enhanced immune escape and was followed with various sublineages due to mutations in the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. However, rapid resurge in COVID-19 reports by Omicron subvariant BF.7(BA.2.75.2) in China and other countries, alarming global threat. The present systematic review was conducted using the MeSH terms and keywords “Omicron” AND “BA.5.2.1.7” OR “BF.7” in Pub Med, Google Scholar and MedRXiv database and grey literature from the authentic database and websites. We identified a total of 14 eligible studies. We have reviewed all the eligible available studies to understand the viral mutations, and factors associated with the increase in the reports of COVID-19 cases in China and across the world and to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination and monoclonal antibodies against the BF.7 variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementnone to declareAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background China lifted strict non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) to prevent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in December 2022. Relatively low levels of immunity and of vaccine booster coverage in the Chinese population raise concerns that future outbreaks will rapidly result in high rates of death and severe illness and will overwhelm health services.Methods This was a compartmental, discrete-time population dynamic model. It compared projected deaths and hospitalisation under various scenarios, including booster vaccine coverage and strictness of NPIs.Results We projected between 268,300 to 398,700 COVID-19 deaths, and peak numbers of hospitalised severe/critical cases between 3.2 to 6.4 per 10,000 population, before the outbreak wave recedes by February 2023. The COVID-19 deaths are reduced by 8% and 30%, respectively, under the weak and strict NPI scenarios, compared with the scenario without NPI measures. Early achievement of high coverage of three vaccine doses will further reduce COVID-19 deaths.Conclusion We projected fewer COVID-19 deaths and hospitalisations than some other models have. Rapid expansion of booster vaccine coverage will only be effective if combined with strict NPIs and/or the high coverage of booster vaccination could be achieved early.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Recent clinical research finds that rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by substantial undocumented asymptomatic infections. Asymptomatic infections have implications for behavioral response to voluntary testing. The paper argues that a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections are hidden due to rational test avoidance behavior, especially among those without perceptible disease symptoms. However, if perception of disease threat is prevalence dependent, testing compliance increases in response to reported infection prevalence rate in the population. This behavior, in turn, affects infection and mortality dynamics. This paper proposes an analytical framework that explicitly incorporates prevalence-dependent testing behavior in a standard epidemiological model, generating distinctive equilibrium epidemiological outcomes with significant policy implications. Numerical simulations show that failure to consider endogenous testing behavior among asymptomatic individuals leads to over- and underestimation of infection rates at the peaks and troughs, respectively, thereby distorting the disease containment policies. The results underscore the importance of augmenting testing capacity as an effective mitigation policy for COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases.JEL Codes I12, I18Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Source data are openly available before the initiation of this study and can be located at: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0883-7I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients have lower seroconversion rates and antibody titers following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, but the reasons for this diminished response are poorly understood. Here, we studied humoral and cellular responses in 95 CLL patients and 30 healthy controls after two BNT162b2 or mRNA-2173 mRNA immunizations. We found that 42% of CLL vaccinees developed SARS-CoV-2-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), while 32% had no response. Interestingly, 26% were seropositive, but had no detectable NAbs, suggesting the maintenance of pre-existing endemic human coronavirus-specific antibodies that cross-react with the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. These individuals had more advanced disease. In treatment-naïve CLL patients, mRNA-2173 induced 12-fold higher NAb titers and 1.7-fold higher response rates than BNT162b2. These data reveal a graded loss of immune function, with pre-existing memory being preserved longer than the capacity to respond to new antigens, and identify mRNA-2173 as a superior vaccine for CLL patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding: These studies were supported in part by funds from the UAB School of Medicine Dean’s office COVID-19 research initiative (https://www.uab.edu/medicine/home/research/covid-19-research) to BML, PAG, and RSD.

%X The Omicron BQ.1.1 variant is now the major SARS-CoV-2 circulating strain in many countries. Because of the many mutations present in its Spike glycoprotein, this variant is resistant to humoral responses elicited by monovalent mRNA vaccines. With the goal to improve immune responses against Omicron subvariants, bivalent mRNA vaccines have recently been approved in several countries. In this study, we measure the capacity of plasma from vaccinated individuals, before and after a fourth dose of mono-or bivalent mRNA vaccine, to recognize and neutralize the ancestral (D614G) and the BQ.1.1 Spikes. Before and after the fourth dose, we observe a significantly better recognition and neutralization of the ancestral Spike. We also observe that fourth-dose vaccinated individuals who have been recently infected recognize and neutralize better the BQ.1.1 Spike, independently of the mRNA vaccine used, than donors who have never been infected or have an older infection.

%X Introduction Intradermal (ID) vaccination may alleviate COVID-19 vaccine shortages and vaccine hesitancy due to systemic reactogenicity among older adults.Objectives To compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of fractional ID and standard intramuscular (IM) booster vaccination of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines in older adults.Methods Participants aged ≥65 years who previously vaccinated with 2-dose ChAdOx1 were randomized to receive one of the four booster vaccinations: 0.1mL ID mRNA-1273, 0.5mL IM mRNA-1273, 0.1mL ID BNT162b2 and 0.3mL IM BNT162b2. Immunogenicity as measured by anti-receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) IgG against Wuhan, neutralising antibody (NAb) against Wuhan and Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5, and IFNγ-producing cells. Local and systemic adverse effects (AEs) were self-reported via an electronic diary card.Results Of the 210 participants enrolled, 70.5% were female and median age was 77.5 years (interquartile range (IQR): 71.0-84.0). Following the booster dose, both ID vaccination induced 37% lower levels of anti-RBD IgG than IM vaccination of the same vaccine. NAb against ancestral and Omicron BA.1 strains was highest following IM mRNA-1273 (1,718 and 617), followed by ID mRNA-1273 (1,212 and 318), IM BNT162b2 (713 and 230), and ID BNT162b2 (587 and 148), respectively. Spike-specific IFNγ responses were similar or higher in the ID groups when compared with their respective IM groups. Vaccine delivery through ID route tended to have lower systemic AEs, although more local AEs reported in ID mRNA-1273 group.Conclusions Fractional ID vaccination induced immunogenicity and reactogenicity comparable to IM and may be an alternative option for older people.Key pointsFractional dose intradermal mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccination induces robust immunogenicity in adults aged ≥65 years.For each vaccine, intradermal route induced lower humoral but similar or higher cellular immune responses than IM route.Intradermal mRNA-1273 vaccination induced similar immunogenicity to intramuscular BNT162b2 vaccination.Immune responses were marginally lower among participants aged ≥80 years than among participants aged 65-79 years.Systemic reaction was lower following intradermal mRNA COVID-19 vaccination compared with intramuscular vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialTCTR20220112002Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI) (grant number 65-037).

%X We tracked the effective reproduction number Rt of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BF.7 in Beijing in November – December 2022 by fitting a transmission dynamic model parameterized with real-time mobility data to (i) the daily number of new symptomatic cases on November 1-11 (when the zero-covid interventions were still strictly enforced) and (ii) the proportion of individuals who participated in online polls on December 10-22 and self-reported to have been previously test-positive since November 1. After the announcement of “20 measures”, we estimated that Rt increased to 3.44 (95% CrI: 2.82 – 4.14) on November 18 and the infection incidence peaked on December 11. The cumulative infection attack rate (i.e. the proportion of population who have been infected since November 1) was 43.1% (95% CrI: 25.6 – 60.9) on December 14 and 75.7% (95% CrI: 60.7 – 84.4) on December 22.

%X Background The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization, spreads globally and was confirmed as the cause of the Omicron wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Shanghai, China. The viral shedding duration of Omicron variants needs to be determined.Methods We retrospectively analyzed 382 patients admitted to a shelter hospital for COVID-19. Of the patients, 8 patients were referred to a designated hospital, 100 were infected asymptomatic patients, and 274 patients had mild COVID-19.Results The vaccination rates (including fully and boosted) in the asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients were 92.00% and 94.16%, respectively. Majority of the studied population showed a first reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold (Ct) value of 20. For 2565 nasopharyngeal swabs from close or sub-close contacts, the Ct value gradually increased to 35 for 8 days, and the median duration of viral shedding time was 10 days after the first positive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 nuclei acid.Conclusions Quantitative viral RNA load assays in COVID-19 (BA.2.2.1) close or sub-closed contacts could be used to prevent transmissions and control precautions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded by Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number Y23H190011), the Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo (grant number 202003N4019), and Ningbo City COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention and Control Project (grant number 202002N7033).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This retrospective study was conducted at the Cixi Dapengshan Shelter Hospital (managed by Ningbo First Hospital, University of Ningbo), and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Ningbo First Hospital (approval No. 2022RS065).

%T Emergence and antibody evasion of BQ, BA.2.75 and SARS-CoV-2 recombinant sublineages in the face of maturing antibody breadth at the population level

%X The Omicron era of the COVID-19 pandemic commenced at the beginning of 2022 and whilst it started with primarily BA.1, it was latter dominated by BA.2 and related sub-lineages. Over the course of 2022, we monitored the potency and breadth of antibody neutralization responses to many emerging variants at two levels: (i) we tracked over 420,000 U.S. plasma donors over time through various vaccine booster roll outs and Omicron waves using sequentially collected IgG pools; (ii) we mapped the antibody response in individuals using blood from strigently curated vaccine and convalescent cohorts. In pooled IgG samples, we observed the maturation of neutralization breadth to Omicron variants over time through continuing vaccine and infection waves. Importantly, in many cases we observed increased antibody breadth to variants that were yet to be in circulation. Determination of viral neutralization at the cohort level supported equivalent coverage across prior and emerging variants with emerging isolates BQ.1.1, XBB.1, BR.2.1 and XBF the most evasive. Further, these emerging variants were resistant to Evusheld, whilst neutralization resistance to Sotrovimab was restricted to BQ.1.1 and XBF. We conclude at this current point in time that dominant variants can evade antibodies at levels equivalent to their most evasive lineage counterparts but sustain an entry phenotype that continues to promote an additional outgrowth advantage. In Australia, BR2.1 and XBF share this phenotype and are dominating across NSW and Victoria.Evidence before this study Up until the BA.5 wave in mid 2022, many global waves were seeded by dominant variants such as Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2. Following resolution of the BA.5, was the emergence of a pool of BA.4/5 and BA.2.75 sub-lineages accumulating clusters of similar polymorphisms located with the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein. Although iterative changes in the Spike increased the ability of each variant to navigate existing neutralising antibodies, it was unclear if this alone was sufficient to provide an outgrowth advantage to any one variant to fuel major case waves in global communities with high vaccine uptake and/or infection.Added value of this study Prior studies on incoming variants in Australian quarantine, highlighted the potential for Australia to represent a unique mix of cocirculating variants. Following the resolution of the BA.5 Omicron wave, many globally circulating variants appeared early on and ranged from BA.2.75 lineages, recombinants XBB.1, and XBC.1 in addition to many BA.5 derived BQ.1 lineages. Two additional lineages, the recombinant XBF and the BA.2.75 derived BR.2.1 also appeared and were uniquely enriched in Australia. Using 14 primary clinical isolates covering a continuum of circulating variants in Australia, we resolved neutralisation responses of 110 donors stringently documented for their vaccine and infection status over time. In addition, we also tested the well clinical utilised clinical monoclonals Evusheld and Sotrovimab. In addition to tracking donors, we also tracked immunity at the population level, using pooled IgG samples over time. The latter samples were the sum of 420,000 US plasma donors covering time periods of high-booster uptake alongside and in addition to large case waves. Whilst the above resolved the impact of Spike changes in neutralisations, we also tested each variant with respect to the efficiency of TMPRSS2 use, as this significantly influences viral tropism across the respiratory tract.Implications of all the available evidence All variants analysed herein have undertaken a convergent trajectory in accumulating a similar cluster of Spike polymorphisms. Many variants, including BQ.1.1, XBB.1, XBF and BR.2.1 have accumulated key changes that now render neutralisation responses lower in all cohorts and are neutralisation resistant to Evusheld. Whilst sotrovimab retained neutralisation capacity of many variants, there was significant reduction for variants BQ.1.1 and XBF. Impact of Spike changes on TMPRSS2 use were mixed and only one variant, BQ.1.2, had equal to increased usage relative to its parent BA.5. Analysis of neutralisation at the population level over time revealed two key observations. Firstly, whilst variants converged and lowered neutralisation responses, this reduction was negated over time with increasing neutralisation breadth. Secondly, responses to a variant proceeded its appearance and global circulation. In conclusion, whilst many variants are appearing and iterative changes in the spike will challenge antibody responses, increasing breadth in the community over time has enabled sufficient coverage to presently emerging variants. Furthermore, with the exception of BQ.1.2, viral use of TMPRSS2 has not increased and as such viral tropism towards epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract we predict will be maintained.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was primarily supported by Australian Medical Foundation research grants MRF2005760 (ST, GM &amp; WDR), MRF2001684 (ADK and ST) and Medical Research Future Fund Antiviral Development Call grant (WDR), Medical Research Future Fund COVID-19 grant (MRFF2001684, ADK &amp; SGT) and the New South Wales Health COVID-19 Research Grants Round 2 (SGT) and the NSW Vaccine Infection and immunology Collaborative (VIIM).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All human serum samples were obtained with written informed consent from the participants and have been approved under Ethics review at St Vincents Hospital, Darlinghurst Sydney Australia (ADAPT Cohort) and Ethics review at the Western Sydney Local Health (WSLHD) District (VIIM cohort)(2020/ETH00964; 2020/ETH02068; 2019/ETH03336; 2021/ETH00180; 2021/ETH0042).

%X Waning immunity to vaccination represents a major challenge in vaccinology. Whether booster vaccination improves the durability of immune responses is unknown. Here we show, using a cohort of 55 adult vaccinees who received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, that a booster (i.e., 3rd immunization) dose at 6 - 10 months increased the half-life of serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers to 76 days from 56 - 66 days estimated after the primary two-dose vaccination series. A second booster dose (i.e., 4th immunization) more than a year after the primary vaccination increased the half-life further to 88 days. However, despite this modestly improved durability in nAb responses against the Wuhan strain, there was a loss in neutralization capacity against Omicron subvariants, especially the recently emerged variants, BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 (35 and 50-fold drop in titers respectively, relative to the ancestral (WA.1) strain. While only 55 – 65% of participants demonstrated a detectable nAb titer against the newer variants after the booster (3rd dose), the response declined to below the detection limit in almost all individuals by 6 months. Notably, even against BA.1 and BA.5, the titers declined rapidly in a third of the vaccinees and were below the detection limit at 6 months. In contrast, booster vaccination induced antigen-specific memory B and T cells that persisted for at least 6 months. Collectively, our data show that the durability of immune responses improves following subsequent booster immunizations; however, the emergence of immune evasive variants reduces the effectiveness of booster doses in preventing infection.Competing Interest StatementB.P. serves on the External Immunology Board of GlaxoSmithKline, and on the Scientific Advisory Board of Sanofi, Medicago, CircBio and Boehringer-Ingelheim.

%X Short-term forecasts can provide predictions of how an epidemic will change in the near future and form a central part of outbreak mitigation and control. Renewal-equation based models are increasingly popular. They infer key epidemiological parameters from historical epidemiological data and forecast future epidemic dynamics without requiring complex mechanistic assumptions. However, these models typically ignore interaction between age-groups, partly due to challenges in parameterising a time varying interaction matrix. Social contact data collected regularly by the CoMix survey during the COVID-19 epidemic in England, provide a means to inform interaction between age-groups in real-time.We developed an age-specific forecasting framework and applied it to two age-stratified time-series: incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimated from a national infection and antibody prevalence survey; and, reported cases according to the UK national COVID-19 dashboard. Jointly fitting our model to social contact data from the CoMix study, we inferred a time-varying next generation matrix which we used to project infections and cases in the four weeks following each of 29 forecast dates between October 2021 and November 2022. We evaluated the forecasts using proper scoring rules and compared performance with three other models with alternative data and specifications alongside two naive baseline models.Overall, incorporating age-interaction improved forecasts of infections and the CoMix-data-informed model was the best performing model at time horizons between two and four weeks. However, this was not true when forecasting cases. We found that age-group-interaction was most important for predicting cases in children and older adults.

%X Background Early evidence suggested that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was less severe in Africa compared to other parts of the world. However, more recent studies indicate higher SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality rates on the continent than previously documented. Research is needed to better understand SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and immunity in Africa.Methods Our collaboration with the Lagos State COVID-19 Taskforce, enabled secondary analyses of immune responses in healthcare workers (HCWs) and Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine recipients from the general population across 5 local government areas (LGAs) in Lagos State, Nigeria. Western blots were used to simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid (N) antibodies and stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with N followed by an IFN-γ ELISA was used to examine T cell responses.Findings Antibody data demonstrated high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 71.6% (96/134) in HCWs and 54.8% (63/115) in the general population. Antibodies directed to only SARS-CoV-2 N, suggesting pre-existing coronavirus immunity, were seen in 10.4% (14/134) of HCWs and 20.0% (23/115) of the general population. T cell data showed that IFN-γ responses against SARS-CoV-2 N were robust in detecting exposure to the virus, demonstrating 87.5% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity.Interpretation These results have important implications for understanding the paradoxical high SARS-CoV-2 infection with low mortality rate in Africa as compared to other parts of the world, as well as for the development of T cell-based diagnostics and vaccines.Funding Harvard University, Motsepe Presidential Research Accelerator Fund for AfricaCompeting Interest StatementBBH is a co-founder of Mir Biosciences, Inc., a company that develops T cell-based diagnostics/vaccines for infections, cancer, and autoimmunity.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Harvard University -Motsepe Presidential Research Accelerator Fund for Africa.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health IRB (#21-0329) and Lagos University Teaching Hospital Health Research Ethics Committee (#ADM/DCST/HREC/APP/4192) gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background A significant proportion of patients experience prolonged pulmonary, cardiocirculatory or neuropsychiatric symptoms after Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), termed post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC). Lung manifestations of PASC include cough, dyspnea on exertion and persistent radiologic abnormalities and have been linked to viral persistence, ongoing inflammation and immune dysregulation. So far, there is limited data on lung histopathology and tissue-based immune cell subtyping in PASC.Methods 51 unvaccinated patients (median age, 40 years; 43% female) with a median of 17 weeks (range, 2-55 weeks) after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (without hospitalization) underwent full clinical evaluation including high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and transbronchial biopsy. We used RT-PCR/FISH and immunohistochemistry (nucleocapsid/spike/CD3/CD4/CD8) for residual SARS-CoV-2 detection and T lymphocyte subtyping, respectively. We assessed interstitial fibrosis and macrophage profiles by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluorescence multiplex staining, while cytokine profiling in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was performed by legendplex immunoassay.Results Dyspnea on exertion was the leading symptom of pulmonary PASC in our cohort. In 16% and 42.9% of patients, FEV1 and MEF50 were ≤ 80% and 35.3% showed low attenuation volume (LAV) in &gt;5% of lung area, in line with airflow obstruction. There was a significant correlation between oxygen pulse and time since COVID (p=0.009). Histopathologically, PASC manifested as organizing pneumonia (OP), fibrinous alveolitis and increased CD4+ T cell infiltrate predominantly around airways (bronchiolitis), while the residual virus components were detectable in only a single PASC patient (2%). T cell infiltrates around small airways were inversely correlated with time since COVID, however, this trend failed to reach statistical significance. We identified discrete interstitial fibrosis and a pro-fibrotic macrophage subtype (CD68/CD163/S100A9) as well as significantly elevated interleukin 1β in BAL fluid from PASC patients (p=0.01), but H-scores for fibrotic macrophage population did not correlate with severity of clinical symptoms or T cell infiltration.Interpretation We show decreased FEV1/MEF50 and increased LAV in line with obstructive lung disease due to CD4+ T cell-predominant bronchiolitis as well as evidence of pro-fibrotic signaling in a subset of unvaccinated PASC patients. Since our results point towards self-limiting inflammation of small airways without detectable viral reservoirs, it remains unclear whether pulmonary symptoms in PASC are SARS-CoV-2-specific or represent a general response to viral infection. Still, evidence of pro-fibrotic signaling should warrant clincal follow-up and further research into possible long-time fibrotic remodeling in PASC patients.Key pointsDyspnea on exertion is the leading clinical manifestation of PASC in the lunga minority of pts have significantly impaired lung function (FVC/TLC≤80% or DLCO≤70%) in spiroergometry and/or radiologic abnormalities, oxygen pulse seems to normalize over time16% and 42.9% of pts have FEV1 and MEF50≤80% and 35.3% have LAV&gt;5% of lung area, in line with airflow obstruction due to bronchiolitisResidual virus was not detectable in the lung tissue of all but one PASC patient (2%)Histologically, PASC may manifest as T cell-mediated bronchiolitis, OP and fibrinous alveolitisThere is evidence of fibrotic remodeling (ultrastructural interstitial fibrosis, pro-fibrotic macrophage subpopulation, pro-fibrotic cytokine IL-1β in BAL) but this did not correlate with the degree of T cell infiltrate/bronchiolitisCompeting Interest StatementDG and KS were speakers for Boehringer-Ingelheim.

%X Several SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants have recently emerged, becoming the dominant circulating strains in many countries. These variants contain a large number of mutations in their Spike glycoprotein, raising concerns about vaccine efficacy. In this study, we evaluate the ability of plasma from a cohort of individuals that received three doses of mRNA vaccine to recognize and neutralize these Omicron subvariant Spikes. We observed that BA.4/5 and BQ.1.1 Spikes are markedly less recognized and neutralized compared to the D614G and the other Omicron subvariant Spikes tested. Also, individuals who have been infected before or after vaccination present better humoral responses than SARS-CoV-2 naïve vaccinated individuals, thus indicating that hybrid immunity generates better humoral responses against these subvariants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by le Ministere de l Economie et de l Innovation du Quebec, Programme de soutien aux organismes de recherche et d innovation to A.F. and by the Fondation du CHUM.

%X Multiple monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be effective for both prophylaxis and therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we aggregate data from randomized controlled trials assessing the use of monoclonal antibodies in preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We use data on changes in the in vivo concentration of monoclonal antibodies, and the associated protection from COVID-19, over time to model the dose-response relationship of monoclonal antibodies for prophylaxis. We estimate that 50% protection from COVID-19 is achieved with a monoclonal antibody concentration of 54-fold of the in vitro IC50 (95% CI: 16 – 183). This relationship provides a quantitative tool allowing prediction of the prophylactic efficacy and duration of protection for new monoclonal antibodies administered at different doses and against different SARS-CoV-2 variants.Finally, we compare the relationship between neutralization titer and protection from COVID-19 after either monoclonal antibody treatment or vaccination. We find no evidence for a difference between the 50% protective titer for monoclonal antibodies and vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by an Australian government Medical Research Future Fund awards GNT2002073 (to MPD, SJK), MRF2005544 (to SJK and MPD), MRF2005760 (to MPD), an NHMRC program grant GNT1149990 (SJK and MPD), and the Victorian Government (SJK).

%X Objectives Several countries have authorized a booster vaccine campaign to combat the spread of COVID-19. Data on persistence of booster vaccine-induced immunity against new Omicron subvariants are still limited. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the serological immune response of COVID-19 booster after CoronaVac-priming.Methods A total of 187 CoronaVac-primed participants were enrolled and received an inactivated (BBIBP), viral vector (AZD1222) or mRNA vaccine (full-/half-dose BNT162B2, full-/half-dose mRNA-1273) as a booster dose. The persistence of humoral immunity both binding and neutralizing antibodies against wild-type and Omicron was determined on day 90– 120 after booster.Results A waning of total RBD immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 variants was observed 90–120 days after booster vaccination. Participants who received mRNA-1273 had the highest persistence of the immunogenicity response, followed by BNT162b2, AZD1222, and BBIBP-CorV. The responses between full and half doses of mRNA-1273 were comparable. The percentage reduction of binding antibody ranged from 50% to 75% among all booster vaccine.Conclusions The antibody response substantially waned after 90–120 days post-booster dose. The heterologous mRNA and the viral vector booster demonstrated higher detectable rate of humoral immune responses against the Omicron variant compared to the inactivated BBIBP booster. Nevertheless, an additional fourth dose is recommended to maintain immune response against infection.HighlightsThe persistence of antibody responses is different among three vaccine platforms.Highly remained antibody levels were observed with the mRNA and viral vector booster.The half-dose mRNA-1273 can be used interchangeably with the full-dose mRNA-1273.The neutralizing activity against BA.5 was lower than wild type and BA.2 subvariant.A fourth dose is recommended for individuals who received an inactivated booster.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThai Registry of Clinical Trials (TCTR 20210910002)Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI), the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital and was supported by the Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University.

%X Optimization of control measures for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in high-risk institutional settings (e.g., prisons, nursing homes, or military bases) depends on how transmission dynamics in the broader community influence outbreak risk locally. We calibrated an individual-based transmission model of a military training camp to the number of RT-PCR positive trainees throughout 2020 and 2021. The predicted number of infected new arrivals closely followed adjusted national incidence and increased early outbreak risk after accounting for vaccination coverage, masking compliance, and virus variants. Outbreak size was strongly correlated with the predicted number of off-base infections among staff during training camp. In addition, off-base infections reduced the impact of arrival screening and masking, while the number of infectious trainees upon arrival reduced the impact of vaccination and staff testing. Our results highlight the importance of outside incidence patterns for modulating risk and the optimal mixture of control measures in institutional settings.Disclaimer The views expressed are those of the authors and should not be construed to represent the positions of the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense, or the Henry M.

%X The milder clinical manifestations of Omicron infection relative to pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 raises the possibility that extensive evolution results in reduced pathogenicity. To test this hypothesis, we quantified induction of cell fusion and cell death in SARS-CoV-2 evolved from ancestral virus during long-term infection. Both cell fusion and death were reduced in Omicron BA.1 infection relative to ancestral virus. Evolved virus was isolated at different times during a 6-month infection in an immunosuppressed individual with advanced HIV disease. The virus isolated 16 days post-reported symptom onset induced fusogenicity and cell death at levels similar to BA.1. However, fusogenicity was increased in virus isolated at 6 months post-symptoms to levels intermediate between BA.1 and ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, infected cell death showed a graded increase from earlier to later isolates. These results may indicate that, at least by the cellular measures used here, evolution in long-term infection does not necessarily attenuate the virus.Competing Interest StatementAS received an honorarium for a talk given to Pfizer employees.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates award INV-018944 (AS), National Institutes of Health award R01 AI138546 (AS), and South African Medical Research Council Award 6084COAP2020 (AS).

%X BACKGROUND VLPCOV-01 is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine that expresses a membrane-anchored receptor-binding domain (RBD) derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.METHODS A phase 1 study of VLPCOV-01 was conducted at Medical Corporation Heishinkai OPHAC Hospital, Japan. Participants aged 18 to 55 or ≥65 years who had completed two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 6 to 12 months previously were randomised to receive one intramuscular vaccination of 0·3, 1·0, or 3·0 μg VLPCOV-01, 30 μg BNT162b2, or placebo between February 16, 2022, and March 17, 2022. Solicited adverse events were collected up to 6 days post-administration. Interim immunogenicity analyses included SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralising antibody titres. Follow-up for safety and immunogenicity evaluation is ongoing. (The trial is registered: jRCT2051210164).FINDINGS 92 healthy adults were enrolled, with 60 participants receiving VLPCOV-01. No serious adverse events were reported up to 26 weeks, and no prespecified trial-halting events were met. VLPCOV-01 induced robust IgG titres against SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein that were maintained up to 26 weeks in non-elderly participants, with geometric means ranging from 5037 (95% CI 1272–19,940) at 0·3 μg to 12,873 (95% CI 937–17,686) at 3 μg, in comparison to 3166 (95% CI 1619–6191) with 30 μg BNT162b2. Among elderly participants, IgG titres at 26 weeks post-vaccination with 3 μg VLPCOV-01 were 9865 (95% CI 4396–22138) compared to 4183 (95% CI 1436–12180) following vaccination with 30 μg BNT162b2. Pseudovirus neutralising antibody responses were observed against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and strongly correlated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (r=0·950, p&lt;0·001).INTERPRETATION VLPCOV-01 is immunogenic following low dose administration, with anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses comparable to BNT162b2. These findings support further development of VLPCOV-01 as a COVID-19 booster vaccine and the potential for saRNA vectors as a vaccine platform.FUNDING Supported by AMED, Grant No. JP21nf0101627.Competing Interest StatementM Komori, A Morey, K Ishimoto and K Matsuda are employees of VLP Therapeutics, Inc.; W Akahata is a board member, an employee and holds stocks in VLP Therapeutics, Inc. and is a management board member of VLP Therapeutics Japan, LLC; J F Smith and M Nakata are employees and hold stocks in VLP Therapeutics.

%X Background Identifying optimal COVID-19 policies is challenging. For Victoria, Australia (6.6 million people), we evaluated 104 policy packages (two levels of stringency of public health and social measures [PHSMs], by two levels each of mask-wearing and respirator provision during large outbreaks, by 13 vaccination schedules) for nine future SARS-CoV-2 variant scenarios.Methods We used an agent-based model to estimate morbidity, mortality, and costs over 12 months from October 2022 for each scenario. The 104 policies (each averaged over the nine future variant scenarios) were ranked based on four evenly weighted criteria: cost-effectiveness from (a) health system only and (b) health system plus GDP perspectives, (c) deaths and (d) days exceeding hospital occupancy thresholds.Findings More compared to less stringent PHSMs reduced cumulative infections, hospitalisations and deaths but also increased time in stage ≥3 PHSMs. Any further vaccination from October 2022 decreased hospitalisations and deaths by 12% and 27% respectively compared to no further vaccination and was usually a cost-saving intervention from a health expenditure plus GDP perspective. High versus low vaccine coverage decreased deaths by 15% and reduced time in stage ≥3 PHSMs by 20%. The modelled mask policies had modest impacts on morbidity, mortality, and health system pressure. The highest-ranking policy combination was more stringent PHSMs, two further vaccine doses (an Omicron-targeted vaccine followed by a multivalent vaccine) for ≥30-year-olds with high uptake, and promotion of increased mask wearing (but not Government provision of respirators).Interpretation Ongoing vaccination and PHSMs continue to be key components of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Integrated epidemiologic and economic modelling, as exemplified in this paper, can be rapidly updated and used in pandemic decision making.Funding Anonymous donation, University of Melbourne funding.Background Identifying optimal COVID-19 policies is challenging. For Victoria, Australia (6.6 million people), we evaluated 104 policy packages: (a) two levels of stringency of public health and social measures (PHSMs; lower, higher), by (b) two levels each of mask wearing (low, high) and Government respirator provision (nil, yes) during large outbreaks (defined as when the projected number of people in hospital reached &gt;270 or &gt;130 per million population for lower and higher stringency PHSM settings respectively), by (c) 13 vaccination schedules (nil, and four combinations of low/high coverage for ≥30/60-year-olds, each with an Omicron-targeted (OT) booster in the last quarter of 2022 followed by one of: nil, another OT booster in the second quarter of 2023, or a multivalent booster in the second quarter of 2023). These policies were modelled in the setting of nine future SARS-CoV-2 variant scenarios (no major new variant of concern and one of eight variants arriving in November 2022 with different virulence, antigenic, and immune escape profiles).Methods We used an agent-based model to estimate morbidity, mortality, and costs over 12 months from October 2022 for each scenario. The 104 policies (each averaged over the nine future variant scenarios) were ranked based on four evenly weighted criteria: cost-effectiveness from (a) health system only and (b) health system plus GDP perspectives (HALYs valued at AUD 70,000; discount rate 3%), (c) deaths and (d) days exceeding hospital occupancy thresholds.Findings More compared to less stringent PHSMs reduced cumulative infections, hospitalisations and deaths by an average of 25%, 24% and 24% respectively across 468 policy comparisons (other policy and variant scenarios held constant), but also increased time in stage ≥3 (out of 5) PHSMs by an average of 42 days (23 days for low virulence and 70 days for high virulence variants).Any further vaccination from October 2022 decreased hospitalisations and deaths by 12% and 27% respectively compared to no further vaccination, however the cumulative number of infections increased by 10% due to vaccination preferentially decreasing hospitalisation rates that were used to dynamically set PHSM stages. Any further vaccination was of marginal cost-effectiveness from a health system perspective (an average of AUD 77,500 per HALY gained for vaccinating ≥60-year-olds, and AUD 41,600 for 30- to 59-year-olds incremental to ≥60-year-olds), but vaccination also resulted in 36% fewer days in Stage ≥3 PHSMs usually making it a cost-saving intervention from a health expenditure plus GDP perspective. High versus low vaccine coverage reduced deaths by 15% and reduced time in Stage ≥3 PHSMs by 20%.Promotion to increase mask wearing or government provision of respirators during large outbreaks reduced cumulative infections, hospitalisations and deaths over the 12 months by 1% to 2%, and reduced days with hospital occupancy exceeding 750 COVID-19 patients by 2% (4% to 5% in the context of highly virulent variants).The highest-ranking policy combination was more stringent PHSMs, two further vaccine doses (an Omicron-targeted vaccine followed by a multivalent vaccine) for ≥30-year-olds with high uptake, and promotion of increased mask wearing (but not Government provision of respirators).Interpretation Ongoing vaccination and PHSMs continue to be key components of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Integrated epidemiologic and economic modelling, as exemplified in this paper, can be rapidly updated and used in pandemic decision making.Funding Anonymous donation, University of Melbourne funding.Evidence before this study We searched Ovid MEDLINE to 28 July 2022 for studies using the terms (economic evaluation.mp. OR cost effectiveness.mp. OR health economic*.mp.) AND (simulation.mp. OR model*.mp.) AND pandemic*.mp. to identify existing simulation modelling analyses of pandemic preparedness and response that incorporated cost effectiveness considerations. All identified literature examined pandemic influenza and COVID-19 and was highly heterogeneous in terms of modelled interventions (which included school closures, masks, hand hygiene, vaccination, testing strategies, antiviral medication, physical distancing measures, indoor ventilation, and personal protective equipment), quality, context, model structure, and economic evaluation approach.Systematic reviews of COVID-19 modelling studies that include a health economic component generally indicate that SARS-CoV-2 testing, personal protective equipment, masks, and physical distancing measures are cost-effective. However, few prior studies consider optimal packages of interventions (as opposed to standalone interventions), and none explicitly account for ongoing viral evolution or accurately capture the complexities of vaccine- or natural infection-derived immunity to SARS-CoV-2.For example, a previous study integrating a dynamic SARS-CoV-2 transmission model with an economic analysis using a net monetary benefit approach published in early 2021 emphasized the combined public health and economic advantages of COVID-19 vaccination combined with physical distancing measures in the UK. However, considering current knowledge regarding the substantial waning of vaccine effectiveness and relatively low protection against infection conferred by vaccination (compared to more severe clinical outcomes), this model likely over-estimated the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on viral transmission. Scenarios that considered the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and thus associated changes in viral transmissibility, immune escape capacity (which has, in the case of the Omicron variant, greatly reduced protection following vaccination and prior infection) or virulence were also not modelled.Added value of this study To our knowledge, our study is the first that utilises a dynamic disease transmission model combined with an integrated economic evaluation framework to systematically compare COVID-19 policy intervention packages while accounting for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution and waning population immunity. At a high-level, we found that a considerable degree of COVID-19 disease burden should be expected in the future, with modelled interventions only able to partly mitigate pandemic-associated morbidity and mortality in the medium-term.Across nine plausible future SARS-CoV-2 variant scenarios, higher stringency PHSMs notably reduced cumulative infections, hospitalisations and deaths in the 12-month period modelled but had the tradeoff of higher expected societal economic losses. Increasing community mask-wearing and substituting cloth and surgical masks for government supplied respirators during periods of high SARS-CoV-2 morbidity both reduced the number of days with hospital occupancy exceeding 750 COVID-19 patients by 2% on average across scenarios, and minimally reduced the cumulative infection, hospitalization and death burden. Compared to no further vaccines, the modelled vaccination schedules (with next-generation vaccines; one or two further doses) reduced hospitalisations by an average of 12%, and deaths by 27%. Vaccinating ≥30-year-olds was modestly superior to just vaccinating ≥60-year-olds (reducing cumulative deaths, for example, by 3.1%).Considering all policy options together, and ranking by optimality on cost-effectiveness, health system pressure and deaths, the highest ranking policy combinations tended to be a mix of higher stringency PHSMs, promotion to increase mask wearing but no Government-funded respirator provision during large outbreaks, and the administration of two booster vaccine doses within the 12-month period to ≥30-year-olds with associated high coverage (noting gains from vaccinating ≥30-year-olds compared to ≥60-year-olds were modest).Implications of all the available evidence The policy implications of this study are three-fold. Firstly, it reinforces the cost-effectiveness of ongoing vaccination of the public to mitigate morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Secondly, the characteristics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, outside the control of policy makers, will likely substantially influence public health outcomes associated with the pandemic in the future. Finally, at a phase of the pandemic characterised by growing intervention options urgently requiring prioritisation by decision makers alongside a large degree of ongoing uncertainty about future variants, this study provides a framework within which to systematically compare the health and economic benefits and burdens of packages of interventions that can be rapidly updated with new information (such as estimated effectiveness and waning kinetics of newly-developed vaccines) to support policy making.Competing Interest StatementSeparate to the current study, the research group will likely soon receive funding from Moderna to conduct vaccine effectiveness studies in Australia. Moderna had no role in the current study.Clinical Protocols https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/centre-for-epidemiology-and-biostatistics-research/population-interventions/protocols Funding StatementFunding: Anonymous donation, University of Melbourne funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Understanding the serological responses to COVID-19 vaccination in children with history of MIS-C could inform vaccination recommendations. We prospectively enrolled five children hospitalized with MIS-C and measured SARS-CoV-2 binding IgG antibodies to spike protein variants longitudinally pre- and post-Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 primary series COVID-19 vaccination. We found that SARS-CoV-2 variant cross-reactive IgG antibodies waned following acute MIS-C, but were significantly boosted with vaccination and maintained for at least 3 months. We then compared post-vaccination binding, pseudovirus neutralizing, and functional antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) titers to the reference strain (Wuhan-hu-1) and Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) among previously healthy children (n=6) and children with history of MIS-C (n=5) or COVID-19 (n=5). Despite the breadth of binding antibodies elicited by vaccination in all three groups, pseudovirus neutralizing and ADCC titers were reduced to the Omicron variant. Vaccination after MIS-C or COVID-19 (hybrid immunity) conferred advantage in generating pseudovirus neutralizing and functional ADCC antibodies to Omicron.Competing Interest StatementE.J.A. has received personal fees from AbbVie, MedScape, Pfizer, and Sanofi-Pasteur for consulting, and his institution receives funds to conduct clinical research unrelated to this manuscript from MedImmune, Regeneron, PaxVax, Pfizer, GSK, Merck, Novavax, Sanofi-Pasteur, Janssen, and Micron.

%X Background Monocytes and macrophages play a pivotal role in inflammation during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their contribution to the development of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) are not fully elucidated.Methods A cross sectional study was conducted comparing plasma cytokine and monocyte levels among three groups: participants with pulmonary PASC (PPASC) with a reduced predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCOc, &lt;80%; (PG)]; fully recovered from SARS-CoV-2 with no residual symptoms (recovered group, RG); and negative for SARS-CoV-2 (negative group, NG). The expressions of cytokines were measured in plasma of study cohort by Luminex assay. The percentages and numbers of monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes) and monocyte activation (defined by CD169 expression) were analyzed using flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Results Plasma IL-1Ra levels were elevated but FGF levels were reduced in PG compared to NG. Circulating monocytes and three subsets were significantly higher in PG and RG compared to NG. PG and RG exhibited higher levels of CD169+ monocyte counts and higher CD169 expression was detected in intermediate and non-classical monocytes from RG and PG than that found in NG. Further correlation analysis with CD169+ monocyte subsets revealed that CD169+ intermediate monocytes negatively correlated with DLCOc%, and CD169+ non-classical monocytes positively correlated with IL-1α, IL-1β, MIP-1α, Eotaxin, and IFNγ.Conclusion This study present evidence that COVID convalescents exhibit monocyte alteration beyond the acute COVID-19 infection period even in convalescents with no residual symptoms. These data provide further rational for determining the role of monocyte subsets in PPASC pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by Myra W. and Jean Kent Angus Foundation, Ola Hawaii (U54MD0007601), NIH/NHBLI (K12HL143960), the University of Washington / Fred Hutch Center for AIDS Research, an NIH-funded program under award number P30AI027757, and the Molecular and Cellular Immunology Core through the funding of the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) program (P30GM114737).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Queens Medical Center Institutional Review Committee with the University of Hawaii IRB ceding authority (IRB#: RA-2020-053).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Introduction In addition to the original monovalent vaccines available for SARS-CoV-2, bivalent vaccines covering wild-type (WT) and Omicron BA.1 are also available. However, there is a lack of real-world data on the effectiveness of bivalent vaccines as second boosters on the dominant Omicron sublineages, including BA.2 and BA.5.Methods This prospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted at Toyama University Hospital, a tertiary medical center in Japan. Participants (n = 565) who received the first booster vaccination were followed up until 2 weeks after the second booster dose of the monovalent mRNA-1273 (WT group, n = 168) and bivalent BNT162b2 (WT+BA.1 group, n = 23) vaccines. Participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections were excluded from the study. Anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody levels and neutralizing activity were measured. Vaccine-related symptoms were also assessed using a questionnaire after the second booster dose.Results The anti-RBD antibody levels after the second booster dose in the WT and WT+BA.1 group were similar (median [inter quartile], 26262.0 [16951.0–38137.0] U/mL vs. 24840.0 [14828.0–41460.0] U/mL, respectively). Although the neutralization activity of the pooled sera of the WT+BA.1 group was the lowest against BA.5, the activities against BA.2 and BA.5 were higher than those of the WT group in both pseudotyped and live virus assays. Vaccine-related symptoms, including systemic and local symptoms, were strongly correlated with anti-RBD antibody levels and neutralizing titers with significant differences.Conclusion The second booster dose of the bivalent (WT/Omicron BA.1) vaccine induced higher neutralizing activity against BA.2 and BA.5 than that of the original monovalent vaccine.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases from the AMED (grant number JP20he0622035) (YM, HT, and YY) and (grant number JP21fk0108588) (YM and HT), a research funding grant from the president of the University of Toyama (YM, NH, and YY), Toyama Pharmaceutical Valley Development Consortium (YM, NH, and YY), Morinomiyako Medical Research Foundation (HK), Kurozumi Medical Foundation (HK), The Hokuriku Bank grant-in-aid for Young Scientists (HK), and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI grant number JP22K20768 (HK).

%X Summary In response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, governments have adopted a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). These include stringent measures such as strict lockdowns, closing schools, bars and restaurants, curfews, and barrier gestures such as mask-wearing and social distancing. Deciphering the effectiveness of each NPI is critical to responding to future waves and outbreaks. To this end, we first develop a dynamic model of the French COVID-19 epidemics over a one-year period. We rely on a global extended Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) mechanistic model of infection that includes a dynamic transmission rate over time. Multilevel data across French regions are integrated using random effects on the parameters of the mechanistic model, boosting statistical power by multiplying integrated observation series. We estimate the parameters using a new population-based statistical approach based on a Kalman filter, used for the first time in analysing real-world data. We then fit the estimated time-varying transmission rate using a regression model that depends on the NPIs while accounting for vaccination coverage, the occurrence of variants of concern (VoC), and seasonal weather conditions. We show that all NPIs considered have an independent significant association with transmission rates. In addition, we show a strong association between weather conditions that reduces transmission in summer, and we also estimate increased transmissibility of VoC.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported in part by Inria Mission COVID19, project GESTEPID.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:n/aI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Infectious disease control measures often require collective compliance of large numbers of individuals to benefit public health. This raises ethical questions regarding the value of the public health benefit created by individual and collective compliance. Answering these requires estimating the extent to which individual actions prevent infection of others. We develop mathematical techniques enabling quantification of the impacts of individuals or groups complying with three public health measures: border quarantine, isolation of infected individuals, and prevention via vaccination/prophylaxis. The results suggest that (i) these interventions exhibit synergy: they become more effective on a per-individual basis as compliance increases and (ii) There is often significant “overdetermination” of transmission: if a susceptible person contacts multiple infectious individuals, an intervention preventing one transmission may not change the ultimate outcome (thus risk imposed by some individuals may erode the benefits of others’ compliance). These results have implications for public health policy during epidemics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAustralian Mathematical Sciences Institute summer research fellowship (DR, JCM).

%X Background SARS-CoV-2 immunity has declined with subsequent waves and accrual of viral mutations. In vitro studies raise concern for immune escape by BA.4/BA.5, and a study in Qatar showed moderate protection, but these findings have yet to be reproduced.Methods This retrospective cohort study included individuals tested for COVID-19 by PCR during Delta or BA.1/BA.2 and retested during BA.4/BA.5. The preventable fraction (PF) was calculated as ratio of the infection/hospitalization rate for initially positive patients divided by infection/hospitalization rate for initially negative patients, stratified by age, and adjusted for age, gender, comorbidities, and vaccination using logistic regression.Results 20,987 patients met inclusion criteria. Prior Delta infection provided no protection against BA.4/BA.5 infection (Adjusted PF: 11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-21.8); p=0.036) and minimal protection against hospitalization (Adjusted PF: 10.7% (95%CI, 4.9-21.7); p=0.003). In adjusted models, prior BA.1/BA.2 infection provided 45.9% (95%CI, 36.2-54.1) (p &lt;0.001) protection against BA.4/BA.5 reinfection and 18.8% (95% CI, 10.3-28.3) (p&lt;0.0001) protection against hospitalization. Up-to-date vaccination provided modest protection against reinfection with BA.4/BA.5 and hospitalization.Conclusions Prior infection with BA.1/BA.2 and up-to-date vaccination provided modest protection against infection with BA.4/BA.5 and hospitalization, while prior Delta infection provided minimal protection against hospitalization, and no infection protection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board approved this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Immune responses to COVID-19 infection and vaccination are individual and varied. There is a need to understand the timeline of vaccination efficacy against current and yet to be discovered viral mutations. Assessing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the context of immunity to other respiratory viruses is also valuable. Here we demonstrate the capability of a fully automated prototype Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR) system to perform reliable longitudinal serology against a 34-plex respiratory array. The array contains antigens for respiratory syncytial virus, seasonal influenza, common human coronaviruses, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2. AIR measures a change in reflectivity due to the binding of serum antibodies to the antigens on the array. Samples were collected from convalescent COVID-19 donors and individuals vaccinated with a two-dose mRNA vaccine regimen. Vaccinated samples were collected prior to the first dose, one week after the first dose, one week after the second dose, and monthly thereafter. Information following booster dose and/or breakthrough infection is included for a subset of subjects. Longitudinal samples of vaccinated individuals demonstrate a rise and fall of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in agreement with general knowledge of the adaptive immune response and other studies. Linear Regression analysis was performed to understand the relationship between antibodies binding to different antigens on the array. Our analysis identified strong correlations between closely related influenza virus strains as well as correlations between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and human coronavirus 229E. A small test of using diluted whole blood from a fingerstick provided clean arrays with antibody binding comparable to serum. Potential applications include assessing immunity in the context of exposure to multiple respiratory viruses, clinical serology, population monitoring to facilitate public health recommendations, and vaccine development against new viruses and virus mutations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by the New York State Empire State Development Fund, and by the U.S. Department of Defense under AIM Photonics, Air Force Contract FA8650-15-2-5220.

%X As new COVID-19 variants emerge, and disease and population characteristics change, screening strategies may also need to change. We develop a decision-making model that can assist a college to determine an optimal screening strategy based on their characteristics and resources, considering COVID-19 infections/hospitalizations/deaths; peak daily hospitalizations; and the tests required. We also use this tool to generate screening guidelines for the safe opening of college campuses. Our compartmental model simulates disease spread on a hypothetical college campus under co-circulating variants with different disease dynamics, considering: (i) the heterogeneity in disease transmission and outcomes for faculty/staff and students based on vaccination status and level of natural immunity; and (ii) variant- and dose-dependent vaccine efficacy. Using the Spring 2022 academic semester as a case study, we study routine screening strategies, and find that screening the faculty/staff less frequently than the students, and/or the boosted and vaccinated less frequently than the unvaccinated, may avert a higher number of infections per test, compared to universal screening of the entire population at a common frequency. We also discuss key policy issues, including the need to revisit the mitigation objective over time, effective strategies that are informed by booster coverage, and if and when screening alone can compensate for low booster coverage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The severe shortfall in testing supplies during the initial COVID-19 outbreak and ensuing struggle to manage the pandemic have affirmed the critical importance of optimal supply-constrained resource allocation strategies for controlling novel disease epidemics. To address the challenge of constrained resource optimization for managing diseases with complications like pre- and asymptomatic transmission, we develop an integro partial differential equation compartmental disease model which incorporates realistic latent, incubation, and infectious period distributions along with limited testing supplies for identifying and quarantining infected individuals. Our model overcomes the limitations of typical ordinary differential equation compartmental models by decoupling symptom status from model compartments to allow a more realistic representation of symptom onset and presymptomatic transmission. To analyze the influence of these realistic features on disease controllability, we find optimal strategies for reducing total infection sizes that allocate limited testing resources between ‘clinical’ testing, which targets symptomatic individuals, and ‘non-clinical’ testing, which targets non-symptomatic individuals. We apply our model not only to the original, delta, and omicron COVID-19 variants, but also to generically parameterized disease systems with varying mismatches between latent and incubation period distributions, which permit varying degrees of presymptomatic transmission or symptom onset before infectiousness. We find that factors that decrease controllability generally call for reduced levels of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies, while the relationship between incubation-latent mismatch, controllability, and optimal strategies is complicated. In particular, though greater degrees of presymptomatic transmission reduce disease controllability, they may increase or decrease the role of non-clinical testing in optimal strategies depending on other disease factors like transmissibility and latent period length. Importantly, our model allows a spectrum of diseases to be compared within a consistent framework such that lessons learned from COVID-19 can be transferred to resource constrained scenarios in future emerging epidemics and analyzed for optimality.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by the Center of Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS) which is financed by Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and by the Saxon Ministry for Science, Culture and Tourism (SMWK) with tax funds on the basis of the budget approved by the Saxon State Parliament.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The Advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the use of auditory data for detecting various diseases, including COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection has claimed more than 6 million lives till date and hence, needs a robust screening technique to control the disease spread. In the present study we developed and validated the Swaasa AI platform for screening and prioritizing COVID-19 patients based on the signature cough sound and the symptoms presented by the subjects. The cough data records collected from 234 COVID-19 suspects were subjected to validate the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and tabular features-based algorithm. The likelihood of the disease was predicted by combining the final output obtained from both the models. In the clinical validation phase, Swaasa was found to be 75.54% accurate in detecting the likely presence of COVID-19 with 95.45% sensitivity and 73.46% specificity. The pilot testing of Swaasa was carried out on 183 presumptive COVID subjects, out of which 82 subjects were found to be positive for the disease by Swaasa. Among them, 58 subjects were truly COVID-19 positive, which corresponds to a Positive Predictive Value of 70.73%. The currently available rapid screening methods are very costly and require technical expertise, therefore a cost effective, remote monitoring tool would be very beneficial for preliminary screening of the potential COVID-19 subject.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocols http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/showallp.php?mid1=60601&amp;EncHid=&amp;userName=Swaasa%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Platform%20for%20detecting%20likely%20presence%20of%20Pulmonary%20Tuberculosis Funding StatementThis study is supported by the UK Government (British High Commission, New Delhi).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of Andhra Medical College gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has demonstrated enhanced transmissibility and escape of vaccine-derived immunity. While current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death, robust evidence on vaccine effectiveness (VE) against all Omicron infections (i.e. irrespective of symptoms) remains sparse. We addressed this knowledge-gap using a community-wide serosurvey with 5,310 subjects by estimating how vaccination histories modulated risk of infection in Hong Kong (which was largely infection naïve) during a large wave of Omicron epidemic during January-July 2022. We estimated that Omicron infected 45% (41-48%) of the Hong Kong population. Three and four doses of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac were effective against Omicron infection (VE of 47% (95% credible interval 34-68%) and 70% (43-99%) for three and four doses of BNT162b2 respectively; VE of 31% (1-73%) and 59% (10-99%) for three and four doses of CoronaVac respectively) seven days after vaccination, but protection waned with half-lives of 15 (3-47) weeks for BNT162b2 and 5 (1-37) weeks for CoronaVac. Our findings suggest that booster vaccination can temporarily enhance population immunity ahead of anticipated waves of infections.Competing Interest StatementA Hachim, N Kavian, LLM Poon, JSM Peiris and SA Valkenburg have filed an IDF (US 63/016,898) for the use of ORF8 and ORF3b as diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

%X In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many higher educational institutions moved their courses on-line in hopes of slowing disease spread. The advent of multiple highly-effective vaccines offers the promise of a return to “normal” in-person operations, but it is not clear if—or for how long—campuses should employ non-pharmaceutical interventions such as requiring masks or capping the size of in-person courses. In this study, we develop and fine-tune a model of COVID-19 spread to UC Merced’s student and faculty population. We perform a global sensitivity analysis to consider how both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions impact disease spread. Our work reveals that vaccines alone may not be sufficient to eradicate disease dynamics and that significant contact with an infectious surrounding community will maintain infections on-campus. Our work provides a foundation for higher-education planning allowing campuses to balance the benefits of in-person instruction with the ability to quarantine/isolate infectious individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work presented in this manuscript is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (DMS 1840265 and ACI 1429783), the Joint Initiative to Support Research at the Interface of the Biological and Mathematical Sciences between the National Science Foundation Division of Mathematical Sciences (NSF DMS) and National Institutes of Health National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIH NIGMS) (Grant No. R01 GM126548), and UC Merced COVID-19 Seed Grant.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X A critical factor in infectious disease control is the risk of an outbreak overwhelming local healthcare capacity. The overall demand on healthcare services will depend on disease severity, but the precise timing and size of peak demand also depends on the time interval (or clinical time delay) between initial infection, and development of severe disease. A broader distribution of intervals may draw that demand out over a longer period, but have a lower peak demand. These interval distributions are therefore important in modelling trajectories of e.g. hospital admissions, given a trajectory of incidence. Conversely, as testing rates decline, an incidence trajectory may need to be inferred through the delayed, but relatively unbiased signal of hospital admissions.Healthcare demand has been extensively modelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, where localised waves of infection have imposed severe stresses on healthcare services. While the initial acute threat posed by this disease has since subsided from immunity buildup from vaccination and prior infection, prevalence remains high and waning immunity may lead to substantial pressures for years to come. In this work, then, we present a set of interval distributions, for COVID-19 cases and subsequent severe outcomes; hospital admission, ICU admission, and death. These may be used to model more realistic scenarios of hospital admissions and occupancy, given a trajectory of infections or cases.We present a method for obtaining empirical distributions using COVID-19 outcomes data from Scotland between September 2020 and January 2022 (N = 31724 hospital admissions, N = 3514 ICU admissions, N = 8306 mortalities). We present separate distributions for individual age, sex, and deprivation of residing community. We show that, while the risk of severe disease following COVID-19 infection is substantially higher for the elderly or those residing in areas of high deprivation, the length of stay shows no strong dependence, suggesting that severe outcomes are equally severe across risk groups. As Scotland and other countries move into a phase where testing is no longer abundant, these intervals may be of use for retrospective modelling of patterns of infection, given data on severe outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work has been funded by the ESRC grant ES/W001489/1: "Real-time monitoring and predictive modelling of the impact of human behaviour and vaccine characteristics on COVID-19 vaccination in Scotland".Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Industrial livestock operations (ILOs), particularly processing facilities, emerged as centers of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in spring 2020. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 underestimate true prevalence. To investigate prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we enrolled 279 participants in North Carolina from February 2021 to July 2022: 90 from households with at least one ILO worker (ILO), 97 from high-ILO intensity areas (ILO neighbors – ILON), and 92 from metropolitan areas (Metro). Participants provided a saliva swab we analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a multiplex immunoassay. Prevalence of infection-induced IgG (positive for nucleocapsid and receptor binding domain) was higher among ILO (63%) compared to ILON (42.9%) and Metro (48.7%) participants (prevalence ratio [PR] =1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06, 1.80; ref. ILON and Metro combined). Prevalence of infection-induced IgG was also higher among ILO participants compared to an Atlanta healthcare worker cohort (PR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.8, 3.3) and a general population cohort in North Carolina (PRs 6.37-10.67). Infection-induced IgG prevalence increased over the study period. Participants reporting not masking in public in the past two weeks had higher infection-induced IgG prevalence (78.6%) compared to participants reporting masking (49.3%) (PR=1.59; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.13). Lower education, more people per bedroom, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and more contact with people outside the home were also associated with higher infection-induced IgG prevalence. Similar proportions of ILO (51.6%), ILON (48.4%), and Metro (55.4%) participants completed the COVID-19 primary vaccination series; median completion was more than four months later for ILO compared to ILON and Metro participants.Importance Few studies have measured COVID-19 seroprevalence in North Carolina, especially among rural, Black, and Hispanic/Latino communities that have been heavily affected. Antibody results show high rates of COVID-19 among industrial livestock operation workers and their household members. Antibody results add to evidence of health disparities in COVID-19 by socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Associations between masking and physical distancing with antibody results also add to evidence of the effectiveness of these prevention strategies. Delays in the timing of receipt of COVID-19 vaccination reinforce the importance of dismantling vaccination barriers, especially for industrial livestock operation workers and their household members.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by an anonymous gift, the JHU COVID-19 Research and Response Program, the FIA Foundation, and NIAID R21 R21AI139784.

%X Efforts to track and model SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in the population have been complicated by certain aspects of the transmission characteristics, which include a pre-symptomatic infectious phase as well as asymptomatic infectious individuals. Another problem is that many models focus on case count, as there has been (and is) limited data regarding infection status of members of the population, which is the most important aspect for constructing transmission models. This paper describes and explains the parameterization, calibration, and revision of the NC-COVID model, a compartmental model to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics for the state of North Carolina, US. The model was developed early in the pandemic to provide rapid, up-to-date state-level estimates of the number of people who were currently infected, were immune from a prior infection, and remained susceptible to infection. As a post modeling exercise, we assessed the veracity of the model by comparing its output to SARS-CoV-2 viral particle concentrations detected in wastewater data and to estimates of people infected using COVID-19 deaths. The NC-COVID model was highly correlated with these independently derived estimates, suggesting that it produced accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in North Carolina.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding for this project was provided by The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), award number 1K01AI151197-01 (PI: P Delamater).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Retrospective epidemiological models are powerful tools to understand its transmission dynamics and to assess the efficacy of different control measures. This study summarises key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 for retrospective mathematical and clinical modeling. A review of scientific papers and preprints published in English between 1 January and 15 April 2020 in PubMed, MedRxiv and BioRxiv was performed to obtain epidemiological parameters of the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Asia. After excluding articles with unacceptable risks of bias and those that remained as preprints as of 15 November 2021, meta-analyses were performed to derive summary effect estimates from the data collected using the statistical software R. Out of 4,893 articles identified, 88 provided data for 22 parameters for the overall population and 7 specifically for children. Meta-analyses were conducted considering time period as a categorical moderator when it was statistically significant. The results obtained are essential for building more reliable models to help clinicians and policymakers improve their knowledge on COVID-19 and apply it in future decisions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the University of Alicante [grant number COVID-19 2020-41.30.6P.0016] and the Conselleria de Agricultura, Desarrollo Rural, Emergencia Climatica y Transicion Ecologica de Generalitat Valenciana, Ajuntament de Denia and University of Alicante through the Montgo-Denia-UA Research Station Agreement [grant number 20202-41.30.6O.00.01].Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a cheaper and faster testing alternative for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, high false-positive rate due to misamplification is one of the major limitations. To overcome misamplifications, we developed colorimetric and fluorometric RT-LAMP assays. The assay performances was verified by the gold-standard RT-qPCR technique on 150 clinical samples. Compared to other primer sets with six primers (N, S, and RdRp), E-ID1 primer set, including five primers, performed superbly on both colorimetric and fluorometric assays, yielding sensitivities of 89.5% and 100%, respectively, with a limit of detection of 20 copies/µL. The colorimetric RT-LAMP had a specificity of 97.2% and an accuracy of 94.5%, while the fluorometric RT-LAMP obtained 96.9% and 98%, respectively. No misamplification was evident even after 120 minutes, which is crucial for the success of this technique. These findings are important to support the use of RT-LAMP in the healthcare systems in fighting COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is funded by Institute for Research and Medical Consultations (IRMC) under the project number 2020-IRMC-S-3 and the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU) Fast track fund of COVID-19 (COVID19-2020-026-IRMC).

%X Background Decision-makers impose COVID-19 mitigations based on public health indicators such as reported cases, which are sensitive to fluctuations in supply and demand for diagnostic testing, and hospital admissions, which lag infections by up to two weeks. Imposing mitigations too early has unnecessary economic costs, while imposing too late leads to uncontrolled epidemics with unnecessary cases and deaths. Sentinel surveillance of recently-symptomatic individuals in outpatient testing sites may overcome biases and lags in conventional indicators, but the minimal outpatient sentinel surveillance system needed for reliable trend estimation remains unknown.Methods We used a stochastic, compartmental transmission model to evaluate the performance of various surveillance indicators at reliably triggering an alarm in response to, but not before, a step increase in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The surveillance indicators included hospital admissions, hospital occupancy, and sentinel cases with varying levels of sampling effort capturing 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100% of incident mild cases. We tested 3 levels of transmission increase, 3 population sizes, and condition of either simultaneous transmission increase, or lagged increase in older population. We compared the indicators’ performance at triggering alarm soon after, but not prior, to the transmission increase.Results Compared to surveillance based on hospital admissions, outpatient sentinel surveillance that captured at least 20% of incident mild cases could trigger alarm 2 to 5 days earlier for a mild increase in transmission and 6 days earlier for moderate or strong increase. Sentinel surveillance triggered fewer false alarms and averted more deaths per day spent in mitigation. When transmission increase in older populations lagged increase in younger populations by 14 days, sentinel surveillance extended its lead time over hospital admissions by an additional 2 days.Conclusions Sentinel surveillance of mild symptomatic cases can provide more timely and reliable information on changes in transmission to inform decision-makers in an epidemic like COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementKBT and JG were supported by the Peter G.

%X Multiple studies of vaccinated and convalescent cohorts have demonstrated that serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers correlate with protection against COVID-19. However, the induction of multiple layers of immunity following SARS-CoV-2 exposure has complicated the establishment of nAbs as a mechanistic correlate of protection (CoP) and hindered the definition of a protective nAb threshold. Here, we show that a half-life extended monoclonal antibody (adintrevimab) provides approximately 50% protection against symptomatic COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2-naïve adults at low serum nAb titers on the order of 1:30. Vaccine modeling supports a similar 50% protective nAb threshold, suggesting low levels of serum nAb can protect in both monoclonal and polyclonal settings. Extrapolation of adintrevimab pharmacokinetic data suggests that protection against susceptible variants could be maintained for approximately 3 years. The results provide a benchmark for the selection of next-generation vaccine candidates and support the use of broad, long-acting monoclonal antibodies as an alternative or supplement to vaccination in high-risk populations.Competing Interest StatementL.M.W., P.S., K.N., and Y.L., are employees of Invivyd, Inc and hold shares in Invivyd, Inc.Clinical TrialNCT04859517Funding StatementB.M.G. and J.M.D. were supported by NIH/NIAID grant 5U19AI142777.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by Advarra Central IRB in the US and by the local IRBs of other participating countriesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Objective On September 13, 2021, teleworking ended for New York City municipal employees, and Department of Education (DOE) employees returned to reopened schools. On October 29, COVID-19 vaccination was mandated. We assessed these mandates’ short-term effects on disease transmission.Methods Using difference-in-difference analyses, we calculated COVID-19 incidence rate ratios (IRR) among residents 18–64 years-old by employment status pre- and post-policy implementation.Results IRRs post-(September 23–October 28) vs. pre-(July 5–September 12) return-to-office were similar between office-based City employees and non-City employees. Among DOE employees, the IRR after schools reopened was elevated 28.4% (95% CI: 17.3%–40.3%). Among City employees, the IRR post-(October 29–November 30) vs. pre- (September 23– October 28) vaccination mandate was lowered 20.1% (95% CI: 13.7%–26.0%).Conclusions Workforce mandates influenced disease transmission, among other societal effects.Competing Interest StatementA subset of authors (Dr. Greene, Mr. Tabaei, Dr. Culp, and Ms. Baumgartner) are City of New York employees and were subject to mandates assessed in this analysis.

%X Since March 2020, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has launched several digital applications to support the intervention response to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. At the beginning of 2021, the KSA Government introduced a mandatory immunity passport to regulate access to public venues. The passport was part of the strategy of resuming public activities before reaching high vaccination coverage. The passport was implemented as a new service in the Tawakkalna mobile phone application (App). The immunity passport allowed access to public locations only for the users who recovered from COVID-19 or those who were double vaccinated. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the immunity passport, implemented through the Tawakkalna App, on SARS-CoV-2 spread. We built a spatial-explicit individual-based model to represent the whole KSA population (IBM-KSA) and its dynamic on a national scale. The IBM-KSA was parameterized using country demographic, remote sensing, and epidemiological data. The model included non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination coverage. A social network was created to represent contact heterogeneity and interaction among age groups of the population. The IBM-KSA also simulated the movement of people across the country based on a gravity model. We used the IBM-KSA to evaluate the effect of the immunity passport on the COVID-19 epidemic’s outcomes. The IBM-KSA results showed that implementing the immunity passport through the Tawakkalna App mitigated the SARS-CoV2 spread. In a scenario without the immunity passport, the KSA could have reported 1,515,468 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 965,725-1,986,966) cases, and 30,309 (95% CI: 19,314-39,739) deaths from March 2021 to November 2021. The comparison of IBM-KSA results with COVID-19 official reporting estimated that the passport effectively reduced the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by 8.7 times, 13.5 times, and 11.9 times, respectively. These results showed that the introduction of the immunity passport through the Tawakkalna App was able to control the spread of the SARS-COV-2 until vaccination reached high coverage. By introducing the immunity passport, The KSA was able to allow to resume most of public activities safely.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFinancing was provided by the Saudi Public Health Authority and the Saudi Ministry of Finance under the Health, Nutrition and Population Reimbursable Advisory Services Program (P172148) between the World Bank and the Saudi Public Health Authority.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Mathematical modeling studies have shown that repetitive screening can be used to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in primary schools while keeping schools open. However, not much is known about how transmission progresses within schools and whether there is a risk of importation to households. In this study, we reconstructed outbreaks observed during a prospective study in a primary school and associated households in Liège (Belgium) during the academic year 2020-2021. In addition we performed a simulation study to investigate how the accuracy of estimated weekly positivity rates in a school depends on the proportion of a school that is sampled in a repetitive screening strategy. We found that transmission occurred mainly within the school environment and that observed positivity rates are a good approximation to the true positivity rate, especially in children. This study shows that it is worthwile to implement repetitive testing in school settings, which in addition to reducing infections can lead to a better understanding of the extent of transmission in schools during a pandemic and importation risk at the community level.Competing Interest StatementCh.M. received grants from Fondation Léon Fredericq and FIRS during the conduct of the study.

%X In winter 2020 and 2021 many countries worldwide experienced a COVID-19 pandemic wave which led to severe burdens on healthcare systems and huge economic losses. Yet, it remains unclear how the winter waves started and many debates are ongoing about actions necessary to prevent future winter waves. In this study we deciphered the dynamic course of a winter wave in 2021 in Saxony, a state in Eastern Germany neighboring Czech Republic and Poland. The information we achieved might help future pandemic prevention.The dynamic course of the 2021 winter wave in Saxony was investigated through integration of multiple virus genomic epidemiology approaches and functional evaluations of locally circulating variants. Through international collaborations, we performed genomic epidemiology analysis on a weekly base with samples from Saxony and also from one neighbor region in the Czech Republic. Phylogeny analyses were used to track transmission chains, monitor virus genetic changes and identify emerging variants. Phylodynamic approaches have been applied to track the dynamic changes of transmission clusters. For identified local variants of interest, active viruses were isolated and functional evaluations were performed.Genomic epidemiology studies revealed multiple long-lasting community transmission clusters acting as the major driving forces for the winter wave 2021. Analysis of the dynamic courses of two representative long-lasting community transmission clusters indicated similar dynamic changes. In the first 6-8 weeks, the relevant variant was mainly circulating in a small region among young and middle-aged people; after eight weeks, the ratio of people aged above 60 years in the infected population markedly increased, and the virus got more widely spread to distant regions. On the other hand, the transmission cluster caused by a locally occurring variant showed a different transmission pattern. It got geographically widely distributed within six weeks, with many people aged above 60 years being infected since the beginning of the cluster, indicating a higher risk for escalating healthcare burdens. This variant displayed a relative growth advantage compared to co-circulating Delta sub-lineages. Functional analyses revealed a replication advantage, but no advantage in immune evasion ability.This study indicated that long-lasting community transmission clusters starting between August and October caused by imported variants as well as locally occurring variants all contributed to the development of the 2021 winter wave in Saxony. In particular, the cluster derived from a locally occurring variant with certain growth advantage might have stressed local healthcare systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementParts of this study were supported by a grant from the German Ministry of Health (BMG) to A.D.

%X Modern health care needs preventive vaccines and therapeutic treatments with stability against pathogen mutations to cope with current and future viral infections. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our analytic and predictive tool identified a set of eight short SARS-CoV-2 S-spike protein epitopes that had the potential to persistently avoid mutation. Here a combination of genetic, Systems Biology and protein structure analyses confirm the stability of our identified epitopes against viral mutations. Remarkably, this research spans the whole period of the pandemic, during which 93.9% of the eight peptides remained invariable in the globally predominant 43 circulating variants, including Omicron. Likewise, the selected epitopes are conserved in 97% of all 1,514 known SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Finally, experimental analyses performed with these short peptides showed their specific immunoreactivity. This work opens a new perspective on the design of next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies that will remain reliable against future pathogen mutations.HighlightsOur novel method predicts SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are stable against future mutationsGenetic analyses (performed 2 years after epitopes were identified) validate the stability of the identified peptidesThese epitopes remained invariable in 97% of all 1,514 known SARS-CoV-2 lineages93.9% of such peptides were conserved in the 43 variants of most interest, including OmicronCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementDr. Lozano-Perez acknowledges the European Commission ERDF/FEDER Operational Program 'Murcia' CCI No. 2007ES161PO001 (Project No. 14-20/20).

%X Protests during the COVID-19 pandemic present a complex trade-off between democratic rights of freedom of assembly and an epidemic risk, and have created a need for careful assessment of protest-driven infections. Here, we build a coupled disease transmission model and assess the impact of protests on the COVID-19 spread in the continental US using a dataset of 4,121 protests and 1.66 million protesters between April and June of 2020. We find that protests in 2020 had limited effects, creating tens of additional daily cases country-wide, due to their small size. However, a simple scaling relation of protest-driven infections derived from our simulations reveals that very large protests with over millions of participants can significantly boost outbreaks and impact the healthcare system. In the worst-case scenario, very large protests can add over 20,000 daily cases and over 7,000 ICU admissions over the continental US. We hope our model can aid the policy rationale to maintain freedom of assembly in the current and future pandemics, while providing estimates for preparations for a healthcare surge in the worst-case setting.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementM.C. was supported by the Ministry of Universities of the Government of Spain, under the program "Convocatoria de Ayudas para la recualificacion del sistema universitario espanol para 2021-2023, de la Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, de 1 de Julio de 2021".Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study used only openly available human data.

%X Age is a major risk factor for hospitalization and death after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in vaccinees. Suboptimal responses to a primary vaccination course have been reported in the elderly, but there is little information regarding the impact of age on responses to booster third doses. Here we show that individuals 70 or older who received a primary two dose schedule with AZD1222 and booster third dose with mRNA vaccine achieved significantly lower neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus compared to those younger than 70. One month after the booster neither the concentration of serum binding anti spike IgG antibody, nor the frequency of spike-specific B cells showed differences by age grouping. However, the impaired neutralization potency and breadth post-third dose in the elderly was associated with enrichment of circulating “atypical” spike-specific B cells expressing CD11c and FCRL5. Single cell RNA sequencing confirmed an expansion of TBX21-, ITGAX-expressing B cells in the elderly that enriched for B cell activation/receptor signalling pathway genes. Importantly we also observed impaired T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides in the elderly post-booster, both in terms of IFNgamma and IL2 secretion, as well as a decrease in T cell receptor signalling pathway genes. This expansion of atypical B cells and impaired T cell responses may contribute to the generation of less affinity-matured antibodies, with lower neutralizing capacity post-third dose in the elderly. Altogether, our data reveal the extent and potential mechanistic underpinning of the impaired vaccine responses present in the elderly after a booster dose, contributing to their increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe Wellcome Trust Addenbrookes Charitable Trust BRCAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the East of England Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (17/EE/0025).

%X Schools have been closed in the Philippines since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the government already allowed a pilot run of limited in-person classes in low-risk areas. With such development, the present paper aims to explore the question “Is it safe to reopen schools with the current vaccination coverage?” We used an age-stratified COVID-19 agent-based model coupled with social contact probabilities to simulate school reopening and vaccination scenarios in the 17 regions of the country. Through these simulations, we found downtick points for infections and deaths—the vaccination coverage at which we do not expect increases in infections and deaths should schools reopen. We then calculated the School Reopening Viability (SRV) of the regions and visualized these scores with a stop-go map for school reopening. Simulation results suggest that all regions except Regions 7, 9, BARMM, and 13 can already reopen schools without the fear of upticks in infections nor deaths. These regions have lower vaccination coverages relative to the rest of the country, especially against the case of Luzon which has the highest vaccination coverage. We recommend that the areas of concern ramp up their vaccination efforts before reopening schools. At the same time, behavioral factors (mask-wearing, physical distancing, hand-washing) and disease resistance factors (healthy living habits) shall be enforced once schools reopen. Finally, school reopening shall be gradual to ensure the crafting of data-driven (hospital utilization, positivity rate) policies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.

%X Background Understanding the impact of infection-induced immunity on SARS-CoV-2 transmission will provide insight into the transition of SARS-CoV-2 to endemicity. Here we estimate the effects of prior infection induced immunity and children on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in households.Methods We conducted a household cohort study between March 2020-June 2022 in Managua, Nicaragua where when one household member tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, household members are closely monitored for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a pairwise survival model, we estimate the association of infection period, age, symptoms, and infection-induced immunity with secondary attack risk.Results Overall transmission occurred in 72.4% of households, 42% of household contacts were infected and the secondary attack risk was 13.0% (95% CI: 11.7, 14.6). Prior immunity did not impact the probability of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. However, participants with pre-existing infection-induced immunity were half as likely to be infected compared to naïve individuals (RR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.72), but this reduction was not observed in children. Likewise, symptomatic infected individuals were more likely to transmit (RR 24.4, 95% CI: 7.8, 76.1); however, symptom presentation was not associated with infectivity of young children. Young children were less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 than adults. During the omicron era, infection-induced immunity remained protective against infection.Conclusions Infection-induced immunity is associated with protection against infection for adults and adolescents. While young children are less infectious, prior infection and asymptomatic presentation did not reduce their infectivity as was seen in adults. As SARS-CoV-2 transitions to endemicity, children may become more important in transmission dynamics.Article summary Infection-induced immunity protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection for adolescents and adults; however, there was no protection in children. Prior immunity in an infected individual did not impact the probability they will spread SARS-CoV-2 in a household setting.Competing Interest StatementAG serves on an RSV vaccine scientific advisory board for Janssen Pharmaceuticals and has served on a COVID-19 scientific advisory board for Gilead Sciences.

%X BACKGROUND In a number of patients, post-acute COVID syndrome develops after acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Long COVID [LC]). Here, we examined the immune responses and clinical characteristics of individuals with LC compared to age- and gender-matched healthy recovered COVID individuals (HC) during the Omicron pandemic. Immune responses following BNT162b2 (Pfizer) booster are also determined.METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 292 patients (LC, 158; HC, 134) confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection from January to August 2022. We determined anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G (anti-RBD IgG), surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), T-cell subsets, and neutralization of wild-type, BA.1 and BA.5. A subset of patients was voluntarily recruited for booster vaccination with BNT162b2 vaccine and immunogenicity was assessed 4weeks after vaccination.RESULTS Cycle thresholds were higher in the HC group than in the LC group (20.7 vs. 19.7; P&lt;0.039). Anti-RBD IgG was higher at ≤56 days after COVID-19 onset (PC) in 3-dose vaccines compared with 2-dose vaccines in the LC group (P=0.02) and after 57-84 days PC in 3-dose vaccines in the HC group (P&lt;0.001). The sVNT in LC was significantly high against Wuhan and sVNT was 30% lower against the Omicron than the Wuhan. sVNT was relatively sustained in 3-dose vaccines than ≤ 2-dose vaccines. sVNT in the HC group reached its peak at 57-84 days PC as compared with the LC group.CONCLUSIONS These findings imply that LC produced increased neutralizing antibody responses than those with HC. During the Omicron pandemic, immunity after LC has still waned; therefore, a booster vaccine may be needed after 2-3 months from last infection.

%X Background SARS-CoV-2 ongoing pandemic and heterologous immunization approaches implemented worldwide for booster doses call for diversified vaccines portfolio. We report safety and immunogenicity of GRAd-COV2, a novel gorilla adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine, in a phase 2 trial aimed at identifying the appropriate dose and schedule.Method 917 eligible adults aged 18 years or older, including participants with co-morbidities, were randomised to receive, 21 days apart, a single vaccine administration at 2×1011 viral particles (vp) followed by placebo, or repeated vaccine administration at 1×1011 vp, or two doses of placebo. Primary endpoints were the incidence of local and systemic solicited AEs for 7 days post each dose and the post-treatment (35 days after the first dose), geometric mean titers (GMTs) and geometric mean fold rise (GMFRs) of ELISA antibody responses to Spike protein. Additional humoral and cellular immune response parameters were monitored for up to six months.Results The safety profile of GRAd-COV2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain and tenderness at injection site, fatigue, headache, malaise, and myalgia. Neither related SAEs nor deaths were reported. Humoral (binding and neutralizing) Ab responses peaked at day 35 after a single administration, were boosted by a second vaccination, were sustained until day 57 to then decline at day 180. Potent, VOC cross-reactive T cell responses peaked already after first dose with high frequencies of long-lived CD8 T cells.Conclusion GRAd-COV2 was safe, and induced robust immune responses after a single immunization; the second administration increased humoral but not cellular immune responses.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04791423.Funding ReiThera SrlCompeting Interest StatementSCapo, RCam, RD, FG, SBa, AMC, GP, SCo AF are full employees of ReiThera Srl.

%X The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages resulted in drastically increased transmission rates and reduced protection from vaccine-induced immunity. To counteract these effects, multiple booster strategies were used in different countries, although data comparing their efficiency in improving protective immunity remains sparse, especially among vulnerable populations, including older adults. The inactivated CoronaVac vaccine was among the most widely distributed worldwide, particularly in China, and South America. However, whether homologous versus heterologous booster doses in those fully vaccinated with CoronaVac induce distinct humoral responses and whether these responses vary across age groups remain unknown. We analyzed plasma antibody responses from CoronaVac-vaccinated younger or older individuals in central and south America that received a homologous CoronaVac or heterologous BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 booster vaccines. We found that both IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD, as well as neutralization titers against Omicron sublineages, were substantially reduced in participants that received homologous CoronaVac when compared to heterologous BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 booster. This effect was specifically prominent in recipients older than 50 years of age. In this group, CoronaVac booster induced low virus-specific IgG levels and failed to elevate their neutralization titers against any omicron sublineage. Our results point to significant inefficiency in mounting protective anti-viral humoral immunity in those who were primed with CoronaVac followed by CoronaVac booster, particularly among older adults, urging a heterologous regimen in high-risk populations fully vaccinated with CoronaVac.One Sentence Summary Homologous CoronaVac boosters do not improve neutralization responses against current VOCs in older adults in contrast to heterologous regimens.Competing Interest StatementA.I. serves as a consultant for RIGImmune, Xanadu and Revelar Biotherapeutics.

%X Background Contact tracing aims to prevent onward transmission of infectious diseases and data obtained during tracing provide unique information on transmission characteristics. A key performance indicator that has been proposed to evaluate contact tracing is the proportion of cases arising from known contacts. However, few empirical studies have investigated the effectiveness of contact tracing.Methods Using data collected between September 2020 and December 2021 in Belgium, we investigated the impact of contact tracing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We compared confirmed cases that were previously identified as a close contact to those that were not yet known, in terms of their traced contacts and secondary cases as well as the serial interval. In addition, we established contact and transmission patterns by age.Findings Previously traced, hence ‘known’, cases comprised 20% of all cases and they were linked to relatively fewer close contacts as well as fewer secondary cases and a lower secondary attack rate compared to cases that were not already known. In addition we observed a shorter serial interval for ‘known’ cases. There was a relative increase in transmission from children to adults during circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants, without an increase in the extent of contact between these age groups.Interpretation These results suggest that contact tracing in Belgium has been effective in reducing onward transmission and that individuals aware of their exposure to SARS-CoV-2 seemed more reserved in their social contact behaviour. Data from a reference period or region are needed to measure the impact of contact tracing in terms of the number of cases and deaths averted.Competing Interest StatementNaïma Hammami is an employee of the the Flemish Agency for Care and Health and Jorden Boone has been working as a consultant for the agency during the COVID-19 pandemic.

%X Persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been reported in immune-compromised individuals and people undergoing immune-modulatory treatments. Although intrahost evolution has been documented, to our knowledge, no direct evidence of subsequent transmission and stepwise adaptation is available.Here we describe sequential persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections in three individuals that led to the emergence, forward transmission, and continued evolution of a new Omicron sublineage, BA.1.23, over an eight-month period. The initially transmitted BA.1.23 variant encoded seven additional amino acid substitutions within the spike protein (E96D, R346T, L455W, K458M, A484V, H681R, A688V), and displayed substantial resistance to neutralization by sera from boosted and/or Omicron BA.1-infected study participants. Subsequent continued BA.1.23 replication resulted in additional substitutions in the spike protein (S254F, N448S, F456L, M458K, F981L, S982L) as well as in five other virus proteins.Our findings demonstrate that the Omicron BA.1 lineage can diverge further from its already exceptionally mutated genome during persistent infection in more than one host, and also document ongoing transmission of these novel variants. There is an urgent need to implement strategies to prevent prolonged SARS-CoV-2 replication and to limit the spread of newly emerging, neutralization-resistant variants in vulnerable patients.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays (U.S. Provisional Application Numbers: 62/994,252, 63/018,457, 63/020,503 and 63/024,436) and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (U.S. Provisional Application Number: 63/251,020) which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor. Viviana Simon is also listed on the serological assay patent application as co-inventor. Patent applications were submitted by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

%X Background Given the low levels of COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite high levels of natural SARS-CoV-2 exposures, strategies for extending the breadth and longevity of naturally acquired immunity are warranted. Designing such strategies will require a good understanding of natural immunity.Methods We used ELISA to measure whole-spike IgG and spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) total immunoglobulins (Igs) on 585 plasma samples collected longitudinally over five successive time points within six months of COVID-19 diagnosis in 309 COVID-19 patients. We measured antibody neutralizing potency against the wild-type (Wuhan) SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus in a subset of 51 patients over three successive time points. Binding and neutralizing antibody levels and potencies were then tested for correlations with COVID-19 severities, graded according to the National Institute of Health (NIH), USA criteria.Results Rates of sero-conversion increased from Day 0 (day of PCR testing) to Day 180 (six months) (63.6% to 100 %) and (69.3 % to 97%) for anti-spike IgG and anti-spike-RBD binding Igs, respectively. Levels of these binding antibodies peaked at Day 28 (P&lt;0.0001) and were subsequently maintained for six months without significant decay (p&gt;0.99). Similarly, antibody neutralizing potencies peaked at Day 28 (p&lt;0.0001) but had decreased by three-folds, six months after COVID-19 diagnosis (p&lt;0.0001). Binding antibodies levels were highly correlated with neutralizing antibody potencies at all the time points analyzed (r&gt;0.6, P&lt;0.0001). Levels and potencies of binding and neutralizing antibodies increased with disease severity.Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients from Sub-Saharan Africa generate SARS-CoV-2 specific binding antibodies that remain stable during the first six months of infection. Although antibody binding levels and neutralizing potencies were directly correlated, the respective neutralizing antibodies decayed three-fold by the sixth month of COVID-19 diagnosis suggesting that they are short-lived, consistent with what has been observed elsewhere. Thus, just like for other populations, regular vaccination boosters will be required to broaden and sustain the high levels of predominantly naturally acquired anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is funded by EDCTP grant number RIA2020EF-3042.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of Kenya Medical Research Institute gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Successful COVID-19 prevention requires additional measures beyond vaccination, social distancing, and masking. A nasal spray solution containing human IgG1 antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (COVITRAP™) was developed to strengthen other COVID-19 preventive arsenals. Here, we evaluated its pseudovirus neutralization potencies, preclinical and clinical safety profiles, and intranasal SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory effects in healthy volunteers (NCT05358873). COVITRAP™ exhibited broadly potent neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 with PVNT50 values ranging from 0.0035 to 3.1997 μg/ml for the following variants of concern (ranked from lowest to highest): Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Ancestral, Delta, Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.2, Omicron BA.4/5, and Omicron BA.2.75. It demonstrated satisfactory preclinical safety profiles based on evaluations of in vitro cytotoxicity, skin sensitization, intracutaneous reactivity, and systemic toxicity. Its intranasal administration in rats did not yield any detected circulatory levels of the human IgG1 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at any time point during the 120 hours of follow-up. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) was conducted on 36 healthy volunteers who received either COVITRAP™ or a normal saline nasal spray at a 3:1 ratio. Safety of the thrice-daily intranasal administration for 7 days was assessed using nasal sinuscopy, adverse event recording, and self-reporting questionnaires. COVITRAP™ was well tolerated, with no significant adverse effects in healthy volunteers for the entire 14 days of the study. The intranasal SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory effects of COVITRAP™ were evaluated in nasal fluids taken from volunteers pre- and post-administration using a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test. SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory effects in nasal fluids collected immediately or six hours after COVITRAP™ application were significantly increased from baseline for all three variants tested, including Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.2. In conclusion, COVITRAP™ was safe for intranasal use in humans to provide SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory effects in nasal fluids that lasted at least six hours. Therefore, COVITRAP™ can be considered an integral instrument for COVID-19 prevention.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT05358873Funding StatementThis study was sponsored by HIBIOCY Co., Ltd., and funded by the Program Management Unit Competitiveness (PMU-C) [Grant No. C10F650051], Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of the Department of Medical Services, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The role of host immunity in emergence of evasive SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutations under therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) pressure remains to be explored. Here, we show that patients treated with various anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb regimens develop evasive Spike mutations with remarkable speed and high specificity to the targeted mAb-binding sites. Mutations develop more frequently in immunocompromised patients and strongly correlate not only with the neutralizing capacity of the therapeutic mAbs, but also with an anti-inflammatory and healing-promoting host milieu. Machine-learning models based on soluble host-derived biomarkers identified patients at high risk of developing escape mutations against therapeutic mAbs with high accuracy. While our data demonstrate that host-driven immune and non-immune responses are essential for development of mutant SARS-CoV-2, these data could also support point-of-care decision making in reducing the risk of mAb treatment failure and improving mitigation strategies for possible dissemination of escape SARS-CoV-2 mutants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the ORCHESTRA project, which has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101016167.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University Hospital Verona Ethic Board (protocol number: 19293) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X For the last two years, the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread all around the world and led to the COVID-19 pandemic. The need of methods to control the pandemic and to propose rapid and efficient diagnostic tools has emerged. In this perspective, SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) have been developed. We performed a retrospective study on 638 collected nasopharyngeal samples used for reference RT-qPCR diagnosis to compare the AQ+ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test” from InTec (AQ+ InTec test) performance with other commercially available RADT. We analysed the sensitivity and specificity of the different tests and showed a better overall performance of the AQ+ InTec test, which was confirmed on the SARS-Cov-2 Omicron variant. We then conducted a prospective study on 1428 patients, to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the AQ+ InTec test on nasal and nasopharyngeal samples in a point of care setting. We showed that sensitivity and specificity reach acceptable criteria regarding the official recommendations of the MDCG 2021-21 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Overall, the results of these two studies confirm that the AQ+ InTec test is a valuable tool for testing in a pandemic context with a high proportion of asymptomatic patients who are potential carriers for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is performant on the most current circulating variant Omicron.HighlightsThe sensitivity of the AQ+ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test from InTec reaches 94.4% on nasal samples and 97.4% on nasopharyngeal samples.The performance of the test remains high on asymptomatic patients with a sensitivity of 89.2% on nasal samples and 97.0% on nasopharyngeal samples.Prospective study in a point of care setting revealed a better sensitivity compared with other commercially available rapid antigen detection testsCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialIDRCB2020-A02619-30Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Regional Hospital of OrleansAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The ethics committee of the Regional Hospital of Orleans (France) and the ethics committee of Sud Ouest and Outre Mer (France) gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Historically SARS-CoV-2 secondary attack rates (SAR) have been based on PCR positivity on screening symptomatic contacts, this misses transmission events and identifies only symptomatic contacts who are PCR positive at the time of sampling. We used serology to detect the relative transmissibility of Alpha Variant of Concern (VOC) to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 to calculate household secondary attack rates. We identified index patients diagnosed with Alpha and non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 across two London Hospitals between November 2020 and January 2021 during a prolonged and well adhered national lockdown. We completed a household seroprevalence survey and found that 61.8% of non-VOC exposed household contacts were seropositive compared to 82.1% of Alpha exposed household contacts. The odds of infection doubled with exposure to an index diagnosed with Alpha. There was evidence of transmission events in almost all households. Our data strongly support that estimates of SAR should include serological data to improve accuracy and understanding.Key Messages Secondary attack rates (SAR) in SARS-CoV-2 were previously calculated using PCR positive samples only, it is more accurate to use a household transmission model and screen contacts using serology, as done in this study. SAR should include serological data to improve accuracy and understanding. All households in this study had transmission events. SAR were 61.8% in non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 exposed household contacts compared to 82.1% in Alpha SARS-CoV-2 exposed household contacts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded by the LSHTM COVID-19 response fund Grant number DONAT15914 and performed independently to any intervention by this funder.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The ethics committees of LSHTM (LEO ref:25265), the NHS Health Research authority (IRAS ref:295376), and local hospital review committees gave full ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Since late 2021, the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has driven a new surge of infections across the world. We used a case-ascertained study to determine the features of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in Shanghai, China.Methods We collected detailed information on 323 pediatric cases and their 951 household members in April 2022 during the Omicron outbreak. All household members received consecutively intensive RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and routine symptom monitoring within 14 days after exposure to a confirmed case. We described the characteristics of study participants and estimated the transmission parameters. Both secondary infection attack rates (SARI) and secondary clinical attack rates (SARC) among adult household contacts were computed, through which the transmission heterogeneities in infectivity and susceptibility were characterized and the vaccine effectiveness were estimated.Results We estimated the mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant to be 4.6 (median: 4.4, IQR: 3.1-6.0) days and the mean serial interval to be 3.9 (median:4.0, IQR: 1.4-6.5) days. The overall SARI and SARC among adult household contacts were 77.11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.58%-80.63%) and 67.03% (63.09%-70.98%). We found higher household susceptibility in females, while infectivity was not significantly different in primary cases by age, sex, vaccination status and clinical severity. The estimated VEs of full vaccination was 14.8% (95% CI: 5.8%-22.9%) against Omicron infection and 21.5% (95% CI: 10.4%-31.2%) against symptomatic disease. The booster vaccination was 18.9% (95% CI: 9.0%-27.7%) and 24.3% (95% CI: 12.3%-34.7%) effective against infection and symptomatic disease, respectively.Conclusions We found high household transmission during the Omicron wave in Shanghai due to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission in the context of city-wide lockdown, indicating the importance of early detection and timely isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infections and quarantine of close contacts. Marginal effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against Omicron infection poses great challenge for prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [grant number 20JC141020002], Three-Year Action Plan for Strengthening the Construction of Public Health System in Shanghai (2020-2022) [grant number GWV-3.2] and the Key Development Program of Children's Hospital of Fudan University [grant number EK2022ZX05].Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of Children's Hospital of Fudan University gave ethical approval for this study and participant's informed consent was waivedI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Beyond the unpredictable acute illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, one-fifth of infections unpredictably result in long-term persistence of symptoms despite the apparent clearance of infection. Insights into the mechanisms that underlie post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) will be critical for the prevention and clinical management of long-term complications of COVID-19. Several hypotheses have been proposed that may account for the development of PASC, including persistence of virus or the dysregulation of immunity. Among the immunological changes noted in PASC, alterations in humoral immunity have been observed in some patient subsets. To begin to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogen specific humoral immune responses evolve uniquely in PASC, we performed comprehensive antibody profiling against SARS-CoV-2 and a panel of endemic pathogens or routine vaccine antigens using Systems Serology in a cohort of patients with pre-existing rheumatic disease who either developed or did not develop PASC. A distinct humoral immune response was observed in individuals with PASC. Specifically, individuals with PASC harbored less inflamed and weaker Fcγ receptor binding anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and a significantly expanded and more inflamed antibody response against endemic Coronavirus OC43. Individuals with PASC, further, generated more avid IgM responses and developed an expanded inflammatory OC43 S2-specific Fc-receptor binding response, linked to cross reactivity across SARS-CoV-2 and common coronaviruses. These findings implicate previous common Coronavirus imprinting as a marker for the development of PASC.One Sentence Summary Through high dimensional humoral immune profiling we uncovered the potential importance of previous common Coronavirus imprinting as a novel marker and potential mechanism of an endotype of PASC.Competing Interest StatementG.A. is a founder of SeromYx Systems, Inc. and is a member of the scientific advisory board of Sanofi Pasteur.

%X The unprecedented and overwhelming SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease significantly challenged our way of life, society and the economy. Many questions emerge, a critical one being how to quantify the challenges, realities, intervention effect and influence of the pandemic. With the massive effort that has been in relation to modeling COVID-19, what COVID-19 issues have been modeled? What and how well have epidemiology, AI, data science, machine learning, deep learning, mathematics and social science characterized the COVID-19 epidemic? what are the gaps and opportunities of quantifying the pandemic? Such questions involve a wide body of knowledge and literature, which are unclear but important for present and future health crisis quantification. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the challenges, tasks, methods, progress, gaps and opportunities in relation to modeling COVID-19 processes, data, mitigation and impact. With a research landscape of COVID-19 modeling, we further categorize, summarize, compare and discuss the related methods and the progress which has been made in modeling COVID-19 epidemic transmission processes and dynamics, case identification and tracing, infection diagnosis and medical treatments, non-pharmaceutical interventions and their effects, drug and vaccine development, psychological, economic and social influence and impact, and misinformation, etc. The review shows how modeling methods such as mathematical and statistical models, domain-driven modeling by epidemiological compartmental models, medical and biomedical analysis, AI and data science, in particular shallow and deep machine learning, simulation modeling, social science methods and hybrid modeling have addressed the COVID-19 challenges, what gaps exist and what research directions can be followed for a better future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAustralian Research Council Discovery grant DP190101079 and the ARC Future Fellowship grant FT190100734Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Rapidly and accurately identifying viral infections is an ongoing necessity. We used the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technique to produce a DNA allonamer with two distinct binding domains made allosteric through a linker section; one domain binds SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, inducing a conformational change that allows the reporter domain to bind a fluorescent reporter molecule. We used bead-based fluorescence and immunofluorescence assays to confirm the allonamer’s affinity and specificity for S-protein and confirmed that the allonamer can bind to S-proteins with mutations corresponding to those of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants. We then developed the allonamer-based Quantum-Logic Aptamer Analyte Detection (Q-LAAD) test, a rapid, high-throughput antigen test for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings. We validated Q-LAAD against retrospective and prospective clinical anterior nasal swab samples collected from symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19. Q-LAAD showed 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to the RT-qPCR assay. Q-LAAD has a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.88 TCID50/mL, is cost-effective and convenient, and requires only a common fluorescence plate reader. Q-LAAD may be a useful clinical diagnostic tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. HIGHLIGHTSAllonamers are allosterically-regulated DNA aptamers with multiple binding pocketsQ-LAAD uses allonamers to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in clinical samplesQ-LAAD has high sensitivity and specificity and a low limit of detectionQ-LAAD can detect spike proteins from multiple SARS-CoV-2 variantsQ-LAAD is a dynamic, cost-effective rapid antigen test for detection of SARS-CoV-2Competing Interest StatementElise Overgaard declares no conflicts of interest.

%X Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been deployed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor dynamics in virus burden in local communities. Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, particularly the efforts for whole genome sequencing for variant tracking or identification, are comparatively challenging due to low target concentration, complex microbial and chemical background, and lack of robust nucleic acid recovery experimental procedures. The intrinsic sample limitations are inherent to wastewater. In this study, we evaluated impacts from sample types, certain sample intrinsic features, and processing and sequencing methods on sequencing outcomes with a specific focus on the breadth of genome coverage. We collected 184 composite and grab wastewater samples from the Chicago area between March to October 2021 for SARS-CoV-2 quantification and genomic surveillance. Samples were processed using a mixture of processing methods reflecting different homogenization intensities (HA+Zymo beads, HA+glass beads, and Nanotrap), and were sequenced using two sequencing library preparation kits (the Illumina COVIDseq kit and the QIAseq DIRECT kit). A synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA experiment was performed to validate the potential impacts of processing methods on sequencing outcomes. Our findings suggested that 1) wastewater SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing outcomes were associated with sample types and processing methods 2) in less intensive method processed samples (HA+glass beads), higher genome breadth of coverage in sequencing (over 80%) was associated with N1 concentration &gt; 105 cp/L, while in intensive method (HA+Zymo beads), qPCR results were inconsistent with sequencing outcomes, and 3) sample processing methods and sequencing kits, rather than the extraction methods or intrinsic features of wastewater samples, played important roles in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing. Overall, extra attention should be paid to wastewater sample processing (e.g., concentration and homogenization) for sufficient, good quality RNA yield for downstream sequencing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Walder FoundationAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X We longitudinally profiled immune responses in 102 adults who received BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or ChAdOx1-S (Oxford-AstraZeneca) as their primary vaccinations. Bloods were collected pre-vaccination, 1-7 days after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd doses (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) to assess innate and early adaptive responses, and ∼28 days after the 2nd and 3rd doses to assess immunogenicity. Using a multi-omics approach including RNAseq, cytokine multiplex assay, proteomics, lipidomics, and flow cytometry we identified key differences in the immune responses induced by the ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 vaccines that were correlated with subsequent antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses or vaccine reactogenicity. We observed that vaccination with ChAdOx1-S but not BNT162b2 induced a memory-like response after the first dose, which was correlated with the expression of several proteins involved in complement and coagulation. The COVID-19 Vaccine Immune Responses Study (COVIRS) thus represents a major resource to understand the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of these COVID-19 vaccines.Competing Interest StatementV.I., P.M. and C.M. received funding from AstraZeneca to undertake the proteomics component of this study.

%X Background The variant of concern, Omicron, has become the sole circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant for the past several months. Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5 evolved over the time, with BA.1 causing the largest wave of infections globally in December 2021- January 2022. In this study, we compare the clinical outcomes in patients infected with different Omicron subvariants and compare the relative viral loads, and recovery of infectious virus from upper respiratory specimens.Methods SARS-CoV-2 positive remnant clinical specimens, diagnosed at the Johns Hopkins Microbiology Laboratory between December 2021 and July 2022, were used for whole genome sequencing. The clinical outcomes of infections with Omicron subvariants were compared to infections with BA.1. Cycle threshold values (Ct) and the recovery of infectious virus on VeroTMPRSS2 cell line from clinical specimens were compared.Results The BA.1 was associated with the largest increase in SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate and COVID-19 related hospitalizations at the Johns Hopkins system. After a peak in January cases fell in the spring, but the emergence of BA.2.12.1 followed by BA.5 in May 2022 led to an increase in case positivity and admissions. BA.1 infections had a lower mean Ct when compared to other Omicron subvariants. BA.5 samples had a greater likelihood of having infectious virus at Ct values less than 20.Conclusions Omicron subvariants continue to associate with a relatively high positivity and admissions. The BA.5 infections are more while BA.2 infections are less likely to have infectious virus, suggesting potential differences in infectibility during the Omicron waves.Funding Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contract 75D30121C11061, NIH/NIAID Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance contract HHS N2772201400007C, Johns Hopkins University, Maryland department of health, and The Modeling Infectious Diseases in Healthcare Network (MInD) under awards U01CK000589.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCenters for Disease Control and Prevention contract 75D30121C11061, NIH/NIAID Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance contract HHS N2772201400007C, Johns Hopkins University, Maryland department of health, and The Modeling Infectious Diseases in Healthcare Network (MInD) under awards U01CK000589.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The research was performed with a waiver of consent under the Johns Hopkins protocol IRB00221396I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Importance Estimating the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been difficult in sub-Saharan Africa due to asymptomatic infections and inadequate testing capacity. Antibody responses from serologic surveys can provide an estimate of SARS-CoV-2 exposure at the population level.Objective To estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, attack rates, and re-infection in eastern Uganda using serologic surveillance from 2020 to early 2022.Design Plasma samples from participants in the Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance, and Modeling of Malaria in Uganda (PRISM) Border Cohort were obtained at four sampling intervals: October-November 2020; March-April 2021; August-September 2021; and February-March 2022. Setting: Tororo and Busia districts, Uganda.Participants 1,483 samples from 441 participants living in 76 households were tested. Each participant contributed up to 4 time points for SARS-CoV-2 serology, with almost half of all participants contributing at all 4 time points, and almost 90% contributing at 3 or 4 time points. Information on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status was collected from participants, with the earliest reported vaccinations in the cohort occurring in May 2021.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) The main outcomes of this study were antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as measured with a bead-based serologic assay. Individual-level outcomes were aggregated to population-level SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, attack rates, and boosting rates. Estimates were weighted by the local age distribution based on census data.Results By the end of the Delta wave and before widespread vaccination, nearly 70% of the study population had experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the subsequent Omicron wave, 85% of unvaccinated, previously seronegative individuals were infected for the first time, and ∼50% or more of unvaccinated, already seropositive individuals were likely re-infected, leading to an overall 96% seropositivity in this population. Our results suggest a lower probability of re-infection in individuals with higher pre-existing antibody levels. We found evidence of household clustering of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. We found no significant associations between SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and gender, household size, or recent Plasmodium falciparum malaria exposure.Conclusions and Relevance Findings from this study are consistent with very high infection rates and re-infection rates for SARS-CoV-2 in a rural population from eastern Uganda throughout the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe acknowledge sources of funding support, including from the Schmidt Science Fellows, in partnership with the Rhodes Trust (ST); Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator program (IRB, BG); NIH/NIAID K23AI166009 (JB); NIH/NIAID U19AI089674 (JB, JR, MZ, TK, EA, MK, PJ, GD, BG, IS, IRB); NIH/NIAID U01AI150741 (ST, PJ, BG, IRB); K43TW010365 (JIN); NIH/NIGMS R35GM138361 (IRB).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was approved by the Makerere University School of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee, the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, the University of California, San Francisco, Human Research Protection Program, the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee, and the Stanford University Research Compliance Office.

%X Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with B-cell pathway inhibitors and anti-CD20 antibodies exhibit low humoral response rate (RR) following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. To investigate the relationship between the initial transcriptional response to vaccination with ensuing B and T cell immune responses, we performed a comprehensive immune transcriptome analysis flanked by antibody and T cell assays in peripheral blood prospectively collected from 15 CLL/SLL patients vaccinated with heterologous BNT162b2/ChAdOx1 with follow up at a single institution. The two-dose antibody RR was 40% increasing to 53% after booster. Patients on BTKi, venetoclax ± anti-CD20 antibody within 12 months of vaccination responded less well than those under BTKi alone. The two-dose T cell RR was 80% increasing to 93% after booster. Transcriptome studies revealed that seven patients showed interferon-mediated signaling activation within 2 days and one at 7 days after vaccination. Increasing counts of COVID-19 specific IGHV genes correlated with B-cell reconstitution and improved humoral RR. T cell responses in CLL patients appeared after vaccination regardless of treatment status. A higher humoral RR was associated with BTKi treatment and B-cell reconstitution. Boosting was particularly effective when intrinsic immune status was improved by CLL-treatment.Competing Interest StatementM.A.H. received consultancy fees from AstraZeneca.

%X Background Robust diagnostics, capable of detecting multiple variant of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study we directly compare the diagnostic capabilities of an LFI engineered with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) originating from SARS-CoV-2 NP immunizations to the Abbott BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Antigen CARD.Methods Here we established a library of 18 mAbs specific to SARS-CoV-2 NP and used two of these mAbs (1CV7 and 1CV14) to generate a prototype antigen-detection lateral flow immunoassay (LFI). Samples consisting of remnant RT-PCR positive patient nasopharyngeal swabs preserved in viral transport media (VTM) were tested on the 1CV7/1CV14 LFI and the commercially available BinaxNOW™ test. Assays were allowed to resolve and results were recorded by two observers.Findings A total of 98 remnant SARS-CoV-2 positive patient specimens were tested on both the 1CV7/1CV14 LFI and the BinaxNOW™ test. The 1CV7/1CV14 LFI detected 71 of the total 98 specimens, while the BinaxNOW™ test detected 52 of the 98 specimens. Additionally, the 1CV7/1CV14 LFI consistently detected samples with higher RT-PCR cycle threshold values than the BinaxNOW™ test.Interpretation The 1CV7/1CV14 LFI outperformed the BinaxNOW™ test in the detection of BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants when testing remnant RT-PCR positive patient nasopharyngeal swabs diluted in viral transport media. BA.1 and BA.4 detection was comparable. The data suggest that mAbs derived from SARS-CoV-2 NP can aid in a more sensitive diagnostic immunoassay for COVID-19.Funding The study was funded by the University of Nevada, Reno’s Research and Innovation Office, DxDiscovery, Inc. internal funds, and through AuCoin Laboratory internal funds.Evidence before this study Since the onset of the pandemic, rapid antigen tests have proven themselves to be an accessible, accurate diagnostic platform. The widespread distribution of these tests has aided in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. Data has shown that the tests manufactured at the beginning of the pandemic, utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), are less sensitive at detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron and Omicron subvariants. The reduced sensitivity can lead to diagnostic escape, and possible surges in COVID-19 caseloadsAdded value of this study In this study, a total of 98 remnant RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens were tested on both a prototype rapid antigen test in the form of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) (referred to as the 1CV7/1CV14 LFI) and the available Abbott BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Antigen CARD. The 1CV7/1CV14 LFI detected markedly more specimens (71 of 98) specimens than the BinaxNOW™ test (52 of the 98).Implications of all the available evidence This research suggests that that the use of mAbs isolated from immunizations with protein from SARS-CoV-2 may result in a diagnostic assay that is more sensitive in detection of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, in comparison to the existing BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Antigen CARD.Competing Interest StatementAmanda R.

%X Background The durability and cross-neutralizability of protective antibodies against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants are primary concerns in mitigating (re-)exposures. The role of antibody maturation, the process whereby selection of higher avidity antibodies augments host immunity, to determine SARS-CoV-2 neutralizability was investigated.Methods Sera collected from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals at 2- or 10-months after recovery, and BNT162b2 vaccine recipients at 3 or 25 weeks post-vaccination, were analyzed. Anti-spike IgG avidity was measured on a urea-treated ELISA platform. Neutralizing ability of antibodies was assessed by surrogate virus neutralization. Fold change between variant and wild-type antigen neutralizability was calculated to infer breadth of neutralizability.Results Compared with early-convalescence, the avidity index of late-convalescent sera was significantly higher (median 37.7 (interquartile range 28.4–45.1) vs. 64.9 (57.5–71.5), p &lt; 0.0001), indicative of progressive antibody maturation extending months beyond acute-phase illness. The urea-resistant, high-avidity fraction of IgG was best predictive of neutralizability (Spearman’s r = 0.49 vs. 0.67 for wild-type; 0.18–0.52 vs. 0.48–0.83 for variants). Higher-avidity convalescent sera showed greater cross-neutralizability against SARS-CoV-2 variants (p &lt; 0.001 for Alpha; p &lt; 0.01 for Delta and Omicron). Vaccinees experienced delayed maturation kinetics, translating to limited breadth of neutralizability at week-25 post-vaccination which was only comparable to that of early-convalescence.Conclusions Avidity maturation grants broader neutralizability that is resilient against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. With immunopotentiation through repeat vaccinations becoming a pivotal strategy to accomplish herd immunity, understanding the variable longitudinal evolutions of the two building blocks of ‘hybrid immunity’ is crucial.Competing Interest StatementY.N. and Y.K. report equity ownership of Quantum Molecular Diagnostics, an Osaka Metropolitan University spinout targeting infectious diseases to develop innovative diagnostics.

%X SARS-CoV-2 variants have continuously emerged even as highly effective vaccines have been widely deployed. Reduced neutralization observed against variants of concern (VOC) raises the question as to whether other antiviral antibody activities are similarly compromised, or if they might compensate for lost neutralization activity. In this study, the breadth and potency of antibody recognition and effector function was surveyed in both healthy individuals as well as immunologically vulnerable subjects following either natural infection or receipt of an mRNA vaccine. Considering pregnant women as a model cohort with higher risk of severe illness and death, we observed similar binding and functional breadth for healthy and immunologically vulnerable populations. In contrast, considerably greater functional antibody breadth and potency across VOC was associated with vaccination than prior infection. However, greater antibody functional activity targeting the endemic coronavirus OC43 was noted among convalescent individuals, illustrating a dichotomy in recognition between close and distant human coronavirus strains that was associated with exposure history. Probing the full-length spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) revealed that antibody-mediated Fc effector functions were better maintained against full-length spike as compared to RBD. This analysis of antibody functions in healthy and vulnerable populations across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 VOC and extending through endemic alphacoronavirus strains suggests the differential potential for antibody effector functions to contribute to protecting vaccinated and convalescent subjects as the pandemic progresses and novel variants continue to evolve.One Sentence Summary As compared to natural infection with SARS-CoV-2, vaccination drives superior functional antibody breadth raising hopes for candidate universal CoV vaccines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by the Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as well as extramural support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R01AI120938, R01AI120938S1 and R01AI128779 to A.A.R.T), National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (K23HL151826 to E.M.B), National Cancer Institute (2 P30 CA 023108-41 to M.E.A.), National Institute of General Medical Sciences (P20-GM113132 BioMT Molecular Tools Core to M.E.A.).

%X Background As of 4 September 2020, a total of 53,996 monkeypox cases were confirmed globally. Currently, most monkeypox cases are concentrated in Europe and the Americas, while many countries outside these regions are also continuously observing imported cases. We aimed to estimate the potential global risk of monkeypox importation and consider hypothetical scenarios of travel restrictions by varying passenger volumes via airline travel network.Method Passenger volume data for the airline network, and the time of first confirmed monkeypox case for a total of 1680 airports in 176 countries (and territories) were extracted from publicly available data sources. A survival analysis technique in which the hazard function was a function of effective distance was utilized to estimate the importation risk. Scenarios which selectively reduced the passenger volume from/to countries with detected monkeypox cases and increased/decreased the global passenger volume to the level of 2019 (high volume) or 2021 (low volume) regardless of monkeypox detection were considered for travel restrictions.Results The arrival time ranged from 9 to 48 days since the first case was identified in the UK on 6 May 2022. The estimated risk of importation showed that regardless of the geographic region, most locations will have an intensified importation risk by 31 December 2022. Travel restrictions had a minor impact on the global airline importation risk against monkeypox.Conclusions Instead of preventing the importation of monkeypox cases via airline networks, high risk countries should enhance local capacities for the identification of monkeypox and prepare to carry out contact tracing and isolation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by JST, PRESTO Grant Number JPMJPR21RC, Japan, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI (21K17307).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Data on the role of immunogenicity following the third vaccine dose against Omicron infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-compatible symptoms of infection are limited.Methods First we examined vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the third-dose against the second dose during the Omicron wave among the staff at a tertiary hospital in Tokyo. In a case-control study of a cohort of third vaccine recipients, we compared the pre-infection levels of live-virus neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against Omicron between breakthrough cases and their controls, who had close contact with COVID-19 patients. Among these cases, we examined the association between pre-infection NAb levels and the number of COVID-19-compatible symptoms experienced during the Omicron wave.Results Among the 1456 participants for VE analysis, 60 (4%) breakthrough infections occurred during the Omicron wave (January to March 2022). The third-dose VE for infection, relative to the second dose was 54.6% (95% CI: 14.0–76.0). Among the recipients of the third vaccine, pre-infection NAb levels against Omicron did not significantly differ between the cases and controls. Among the cases, those who experienced COVID-19-compatible symptoms had lower pre-infection NAb levels against Omicron than those who did not.Conclusions The third vaccine dose was effective in decreasing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during the Omicron wave compared with the second dose. Among third-dose recipients, higher pre-infection NAb levels may not be associated with a lower risk of Omicron infection. Contrarily, they may be associated with fewer symptoms of infection.Summary The third vaccine dose reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection risk during the Omicron wave. Higher neutralizing antibody levels may not reduce Omicron infection risk in third-dose patients. On the contrary, it may be associated with fewer symptoms of infection.Competing Interest StatementAbbott Japan and Roche Diagnostics provided reagents for anti-spike antibody assays.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the NCGM COVID-19 Gift Fund (grant number 19K059) and the Japan Health Research Promotion Bureau Research Fund (grant number 2020-B-09).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the NCGM ethics committee (approval number: NCGM-G-003598).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Variability of COVID-19 vaccination effectiveness (VE) should be assessed with a resolution of a few days assuming that VE is influenced by public behavior and social activity. Here the VE for the Omicron variants (BA.2 and BA.5) is numerically derived for Japan’s population for the second and third vaccination doses. We then evaluated the daily VE variation caused by our social behavior from the daily data reports for Tokyo. The vaccination effectiveness for Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5) are derived from the data of Japan and Tokyo with a computational approach. In addition, the effect of different parameters regarding human behavior on VE is assessed using daily data in Tokyo. The individual VE for the Omicron BA.2 in Japan was 61% (95%CI: 57%–65%) for the vaccination second dose from our computation, whereas that for the third dose was 86% (95% CI: 84%–88%). The individual BA.5 VE for the second and third doses are 37% (95% CI: 33%–40%) and 63% (95% CI: 61%–65%). The reduction of daily VE from estimated value was close correlated to the number of tweets related to social gathering in Twitter.

%X Background Recent studies applying chaos theory methods have found the existence of chaotic markers in SARS-CoV-2’s epidemiological data, evidence that has implications on the prediction, modeling and epidemiological analysis of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic with implications for healthcare management.Aim and Methods We study the aggregate data for the new cases per million and the new deaths per million from COVID-19 in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America and Oceania, applying chaos theory’s empirical methods including embedding dimension estimation, Lyapunov spectra estimation, spectral analysis and state-of-the-art topological data analysis methods combining persistent homology, recurrence analysis and machine learning with the aim of characterizing the nature of the dynamics and its predictability.Results The results show that for all regions except Oceania there is evidence of low dimensional noisy chaotic attractors that are near the onset of chaos, with a recurrence structure that can be used by adaptive artificial intelligence solutions equipped with nearest neighbors’ machine learning modules to predict with a very high performance the future values of the two target series for each region. The persistent homology analysis uncovers a division into two groups, the first group comprised of Africa and Asia and the second of Europe, North and South America. For Oceania, we found evidence of the occurrence of a bifurcation which we characterize in detail applying a combination of machine learning and topological analysis methods, we find that the bifurcation in the region is related to the emergence of new variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data used was the COVID-19 Our World In Data (OWID) database available at: https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer The data used was for the period that ended at 07-08-2022, which was the last day available at the time of the study.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X While the development of different vaccines has slowed the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of breakthrough infections continues to fuel the pandemic. As a strategy to secure at least partial protection, with a single dose of a given COVID-19 vaccine to maximum possible fraction of the population, delayed administration of subsequent doses (or boosters) has been implemented in many countries. However, waning immunity and emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that such measures may jeopardize the attainment of herd immunity due to intermittent lapses in protection. Optimizing vaccine dosing schedules could thus make the difference between periodic occurrence of breakthrough infections or effective control of the pandemic. To this end, we have developed a mechanistic mathematical model of adaptive immune response to vaccines and demonstrated its applicability to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as a proof-of-concept for future outbreaks. The model was thoroughly calibrated against multiple clinical datasets involving immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccines in healthy and immunocompromised subjects (cancer patients undergoing therapy); the model showed robust clinical validation by accurately predicting neutralizing antibody kinetics, a correlate of vaccine-induced protection, in response to multiple doses of mRNA vaccines. Importantly, we estimated population vulnerability to breakthrough infections and predicted tailored vaccination dosing schedules to maximize protection and thus minimize breakthrough infections, based on the immune status of a sub-population. We have identified a critical waiting window for cancer patients (or, immunocompromised subjects) to allow recovery of the immune system (particularly CD4+ T-cells) for effective differentiation of B-cells to produce neutralizing antibodies and thus achieve optimal vaccine efficacy against variants of concern, especially between the first and second doses. Also, we have obtained optimized dosing schedules for subsequent doses in healthy and immunocompromised subjects, which vary from the CDC-recommended schedules, to minimize breakthrough infections. The developed modeling tool is based on generalized adaptive immune response to antigens and can thus be leveraged to guide vaccine dosing schedules during future outbreaks.Competing Interest StatementDIS, RP, and WA are listed as inventors on a patent application related to immunization strategies (International Patent Application PCT/ US2020/053758, entitled Targeted Pulmonary Delivery Compositions and Methods Using Same).

%X The first step in SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance is testing to identify infected people. However, global testing rates are falling as we emerge from the acute health emergency and remain low in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (mean = 27 tests/100,000 people/day). We simulated COVID-19 epidemics in a prototypical LMIC to investigate how testing rates, sampling strategies, and sequencing proportions jointly impact surveillance outcomes and showed that low testing rates and spatiotemporal biases delay time-to-detection of new variants by weeks-to-months and can lead to unreliable estimates of variant prevalence even when the proportion of samples sequenced is increased. Accordingly, investments in wider access to diagnostics to support testing rates of ∼100 tests/100,000 people/day could enable more timely detection of new variants and reliable estimates of variant prevalence. The performance of global SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance programs is fundamentally limited by access to diagnostic testing.Competing Interest StatementA.T., E.H., S.C., B.R. and B.E.N. declare that they are employed by FIND, the global alliance for diagnostics.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has fuelled the generation of vaccines at an unprecedented pace and scale. However, many challenges remain, including: the emergence of vaccine-resistant mutant viruses, vaccine stability during storage and transport, waning vaccine-induced immunity, and concerns about infrequent adverse events associated with existing vaccines. Here, we report on a protein subunit vaccine comprising the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, dimerised with an immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain. These were tested in conjunction with three different adjuvants: a TLR2 agonist R4-Pam2Cys, an NKT cell agonist glycolipid α-Galactosylceramide, or MF59® squalene oil-in-water adjuvant. Each formulation drove strong neutralising antibody (nAb) responses and provided durable and highly protective immunity against lower and upper airway infection in mouse models of COVID-19. We have also developed an RBD-human IgG1 Fc vaccine with an RBD sequence of the highly immuno-evasive beta variant (N501Y, E484K, K417N). This ‘beta variant’ RBD vaccine, combined with MF59® adjuvant, induced strong protection in mice against the beta strain as well as the ancestral strain. Furthermore, when used as a third dose booster vaccine following priming with whole spike vaccine, anti-sera from beta-RBD-Fc immunised mice increased titres of nAb against other variants including alpha, delta, delta+, gamma, lambda, mu, and omicron BA.1 and BA.2. These results demonstrated that an RBD-Fc protein subunit/MF59® adjuvanted vaccine can induce high levels of broad nAbs, including when used as a booster following prior immunisation of mice with whole ancestral-strain Spike vaccines. This vaccine platform offers a potential approach to augment some of the currently approved vaccines in the face of emerging variants of concern, and it has now entered a phase I clinical trial.Competing Interest StatementTwo provisional patents covering the RBD-Fc vaccines described in this study, and underlying technology, have been submitted through The University of Melbourne.

%T Strategies for using antigen rapid diagnostic tests to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in low- and middle-income countries: a mathematical modelling study applied to Zambia

%X Background Increasing the availability of antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is key to alleviating global SARS-CoV-2 testing inequity (median testing rate in December 2021-March 2022 when the Omicron variant was spreading in multiple countries; high-income countries=600 tests/100,000 people/day; LMICs=14 tests/ 100,000 people/day). However, target testing levels and effectiveness of asymptomatic community screening to impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission in LMICs are unclear.Methods We used PATAT, an LMIC-focused agent-based model to simulate COVID-19 epidemics, varying the amount of Ag-RDTs available for symptomatic testing at healthcare facilities and asymptomatic community testing in different social settings. We assumed that testing was a function of access to healthcare facilities and availability of Ag-RDTs. We explicitly modelled symptomatic testing demand from non-SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and measured impact based on the number of infections averted due to test-and-isolate.Results Testing symptomatic individuals yields greater benefits than any asymptomatic community testing strategy until most symptomatic individuals who sought testing have been tested.Meeting symptomatic testing demand likely requires at least 200-400 tests/100,000 people/day on average as symptomatic testing demand is highly influenced by non-SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. After symptomatic testing demand is satisfied, excess tests to proactively screen for asymptomatic infections among household members yields the largest additional infections averted.Conclusions Testing strategies aimed at reducing transmission should prioritize symptomatic testing and incentivizing test-positive individuals to adhere to isolation to maximize effectiveness.Competing Interest StatementJ.A.S., A.T., N.H., E.H. and B.E.N. were employed by FIND, the global alliance for diagnostics.Funding StatementA.X.H. and C.A.R. were supported by ERC NaviFlu (No. 818353).

%X Prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, many cities in China had been able to maintain a “Zero-COVID” policy. They were able to achieve this without blanket city-wide lockdown and through widespread testing and an extensive set of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask wearing, contact tracing, and social distancing. We wanted to examine the effectiveness of such a policy in containing SARS-CoV-2 in the early stage of the pandemic. Therefore, we developed a fully stochastic, spatially structured, agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and reconstructed the Beijing Xinfadi outbreak through computational simulations. We found that screening for symptoms and among high-risk populations served as methods to discover cryptic community transmission in the early stage of the outbreak. Effective contact tracing could greatly reduce transmission. Targeted community lockdown and temporal mobility restriction could slow down the spatial spread of the virus, with much less of the population being affected. Population-wide mass testing could further improve the speed at which the outbreak is contained. Our analysis suggests that the containment of SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strains was certainly possible. Outbreak suppression and containment at the beginning of the pandemic, before the virus had the opportunity to undergo extensive adaptive evolution with increasing fitness in the human population, could be much more cost-effective in averting the overall pandemic disease burden and socioeconomic cost.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by grants from the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82130093)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval and informed consent requirements were waived by the Institutional Review Board and Human Research Ethics Committee of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Beijing CDC) because this study was considered a continuation of the public health investigation associated with an emerging infectious disease.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In the two and half years since SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in China, hundreds of millions of people have been infected and millions have died. Along with the immediate need for treatment solutions, the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for mathematical models that can predict the spread of the pandemic in an ever-changing environment. The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model has been widely used to model COVID-19 transmission, however, with limited success. Here, we present a novel, dynamic Monte-Carlo Agent-based Model (MAM), which is based on the basic principles of statistical physics. Using data from Israel on three major outbreaks, we compare predictions made by SIR and MAM, and show that MAM outperforms SIR in all aspects. Furthermore, MAM is a flexible model and allows to accurately examine the effects of vaccinations in different subgroups, and the effects of the introduction of new variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Why public health intervention by the Israeli government against coronavirus disease 2019 spread has been successful while the majority of other countries are still coping with it? To give a quantitative answer, a simple numerical epidemic model is prepared to simulate the entire trend of various infection-related variables considering the 1st and 2nd vaccination campaigns against the alpha variant and simultaneous lockdown. This model is an extension of our previously published deterministic physical model, i.e. Apparent Time Lag Model, which aims at predicting an entire trend of variables in a single epidemic. The time series data of both vaccine dose ratio and lockdown period are employed in the model. Predictions have been compared with observed data in terms of daily new cases, isolated people, infections at large and effective reproductive number, and, further, the model is verified. Moreover, parameter survey calculations for several scenarios have clarified the synergy effects of vaccination and lockdown. In particular, the key element of Israel’s success has been suggested to lie in a high-dose vaccination rate that prevents the onset of a rebound in daily new cases on the rescission of the lockdown.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialN/AFunding StatementWe had no external funding to perform present work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Not applicableI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The primary objective of this study was to identify a universal wastewater biomarker for population normalization for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). A total of 2,624 wastewater samples (41 weeks) were collected weekly during May 2021-April 2022 from 64 wastewater facilities across Missouri, U.S. Three wastewater biomarkers, caffeine and its metabolite, paraxanthine, and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), were compared for the population normalization effectiveness for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Paraxanthine had the lowest temporal variation and strongest relationship between population compared to caffeine and PMMoV. This result was confirmed by data from ten different Wisconsin’s WWTPs with gradients in population sizes, indicating paraxanthine is a promising biomarker of the real-time population across a large geographical region. The estimated real-time population was directly compared against the population patterns with human movement mobility data. Of the three biomarkers, population normalization by paraxanthine significantly strengthened the relationship between wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load and COVID-19 incidence rate the most (40 out of 61 sewersheds). Caffeine could be a promising population biomarker for regions where no significant exogenous caffeine sources (e.g., discharges from food industries) exist. In contrast, PMMoV showed the highest variability over time, and therefore reduced the strength of the relationship between sewage SARS-CoV-2 viral load and the COVID-19 incidence rate, as compared to wastewater data without population normalization and the population normalized by either recent Census population or the population estimated based on the number of residential connections and average household size for that municipality from the Census. Overall, the findings of this long-term surveillance study concluded that the paraxanthine has the best performance as a biomarker for population normalization for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based epidemiology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCenters for Disease Control and the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health under award number U01DA053893-01 USDA/ARS Dale Bumpers Small Farm Research Center under agreement number 58-6020-6-001Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Lori Wilcox, EdD, MS Director HRPP/IRB University of Missouri IRB Determination Notice Project #2093486 Review #382746 The MU Institutional Review Board reviewed your application and supportive documents.

%X Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain of high potential for hotspots for COVID-19 deaths and emerging variants given the inequality of vaccine distribution and their vulnerable healthcare systems. We aim to evaluate containment strategies that are sustainable and effective for LMICs. We constructed synthetic populations with varying contact and household structures to capture LMIC demographic characteristics that vary across communities. Using an agent- based model, we explored the optimal containment strategies for rural and urban communities by designing and simulating setting-specific strategies that deploy rapid diagnostic tests, symptom screening, contact tracing and physical distancing. In low-density rural communities, we found implementing either high quality (sensitivity &gt; 50%) antigen rapid diagnostic tests or moderate physical distancing could contain the transmission. In urban communities, we demonstrated that both physical distancing and case finding are essential for containing COVID-19 (average infection rate &lt; 10%). In high density communities that resemble slums and squatter settlements, physical distancing is less effective compared to rural and urban communities. Lastly, we demonstrated contact tracing is essential for effective containment. Our findings suggested that rapid diagnostic tests could be prioritised for control and monitor COVID-19 transmission and highlighted that contact survey data could guide strategy design to save resources for LMICs. An accompanying open source R package is available for simulating COVID-19 transmission based on contact network models.Competing Interest StatementDisclaimer: The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).

%X Prolonged infections in immunocompromised individuals may be a source for novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly when both the immune system and antiviral therapy fail to clear the infection, thereby promoting adaptation. Here we describe an approximately 16-month case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunocompromised individual. Following monotherapy with the monoclonal antibody Bamlanivimab, the individual’s virus was resistant to this antibody via a globally unique Spike amino acid variant (E484T) that evolved from E484A earlier in infection. With the emergence and spread of the Omicron Variant of Concern, which also contains Spike E484A, E484T may arise again as an antibody-resistant derivative of E484A.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis (HHSN272201400008C), the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis and Transmission (CRIPT) (75N93021C00014), and by CDC Contract #75D30121C11060.

%X Background Booster vaccine doses offer protection against severe COVID-19 caused by omicron but are less effective against infection. Characteristics such as serological correlates of protection, viral abundance, and clearance of omicron infection in triple vaccinated individuals are scarce.Methods We conducted a 4-week twice-weekly SARS-CoV-2 qPCR screening shortly after an mRNA vaccine booster in 368 healthcare workers. Spike-specific IgG levels and neutralization titers were determined at study start. qPCR-positive participants were sampled repeatedly for two weeks and monitored for symptoms.Result In total 81 (cumulative incidence 22%) omicron infections were detected, divided between BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2. Increasing post-booster antibody titers were protective against infection (p&lt;0.05), linked to reduced viral load (p&lt;0.01) and time to viral clearance (p&lt;0.05). Only 10% of infected participants remained asymptomatic through the course of their infection. Viral load peaked at day 3 and live virus could be detected for up to 9 days after first PCR-positive sample. Presence of symptoms correlated to elevated viral load (p&lt;0.0001), but despite resolution of symptoms most participants showed Ct levels &lt;30 at day 9. No significant differences were observed for viral load and time to viral clearance between BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2 infected individuals.Conclusion We report a high incidence of omicron infection despite recent booster vaccination in triple vaccinated individuals. Increasing levels of vaccine-induced spike-specific WT antibodies entail increased protection against infection and reduce viral load if infected. High viral load and secretion of live virus for up to nine days may facilitate transmission in a triple vaccinated population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by Jonas &amp; Christina af Jochnick foundation (CT) Lundblad family foundation (CT); Region Stockholm (CT); Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation (CT, JK); Jonas Soderquists scholarship (CT); Science for Life Laboratory (PN); Erling-Persson family foundation (SoH); Center for Innovative Medicine (JK, KB); and Swedish Research Council (JK).

%X Several vaccines have been found effective against COVID-19, usually administered in homologous regimens, with the same vaccine used for the prime and boost doses. However, recent studies have demonstrated improved protection via heterologous mix-and-match COVID-19 vaccine combinations, and a direct comparison among these regimens is needed to identify the best employment strategies. Here, we show a single-cohort comparison of changes to the humoral and cellular immune compartments following five different COVID-19 vaccines spanning three technologies (adenoviral, mRNA and inactivated vaccines). These vaccines were administered in a combinatorial fashion, resulting in sixteen different homologous and heterologous regimens. SARS-CoV-2-targeting antibody titres were highest when the boost dose consisted of mRNA-1273, independent of the vaccine used for priming. Priming with BBIBP-CorV induced less class-switching among spike-binding memory B cells and the highest antigen-specific T cell responses in heterologous combinations. These were generally more immunogenic in terms of specific antibodies and cellular responses compared to homologous regimens. Finally, single-cell analysis of 754 samples revealed specific B and T cell signatures of the vaccination regimens, indicating distinctive differences in the immune responses. These data provide new insights on the immunological effects of COVID-19 vaccine combinations and a framework for the design of improved vaccination strategies for other pathogens and cancer.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04988048Funding StatementThis project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme grant agreement No 882424 the Swiss National Science Foundation (733 310030 170320 310030 188450 and CRSII5 183478 to B.B.)

%T Targeting ATP2B1 impairs PI3K/Akt/Fox-O3 signaling and reduces SARS-COV-2 replication <em>in vivo</em>

%X ATP2B1 is a known regulator of calcium (Ca2+) cellular export and homeostasis. Diminished levels of extra- or intra-cellular Ca2+ content have been suggested to block SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we demonstrate that a newly nontoxic caloxin-derivative compound (PI-7) inhibits ATP2B1, reduces the extra- and intra-cellular Ca2+ levels and impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation (VOCs: Delta and Omicron 2), as also measured by inhibition of syncytia in vitro. Furthermore, a FOXO3 transcriptional site of regulation of expression at the 5’ end of the ATP2B1 locus, together with a rare homozygous intronic variant in the ATP2B1 locus (rs11337717; chr12:89643729, T&gt;C), are shown to be associated with severity of COVID19 (symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients). Here, we identify the mechanism of action during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which involves the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inactivation of FOXO3 (i.e., phosphorylation), and inhibition of transcriptional control of both membrane and reticulum Ca2+ pumps (ATP2B1 and ATP2A1 [i.e., SERCA1], respectively). The pharmacological action of compound PI-7 on sustaining both ATP2B1 and ATP2A1 expression reduces the intracellular cytoplasmic Ca2+ pool and thus negatively influences SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation. As compound PI-7 shows a lack of toxicity, its prophylactic use as a therapy against the COVID19 pandemic is here proposed.In brief De Antonellis et al. shows the importance of the Ca2+ channel pump ATP2B1 in the regulation of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ levels that positively influence SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Our study identifies the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 in the regulation of the expression of ATP2B1 and ATP2A1 loci during infection via FOXO3 transcriptional factor. Furthermore, a small caloxin-derivative molecule (compound PI-7) can inhibit ATP2B1 activity, thus resulting in SARS-CoV-2 impairment. In further support, we have identified a genetic variant within the noncoding upstream region of ATP2B1 in symtomatic patients affected by severe COVID19, thus indicating this polymorphism as a genetic predisposition factor to SARS-CoV-2 infection.HighlightsAn anti-viral model of network of action for ATP2B1 against SARS-CoV-2 at the intracellular level that involves the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inactivation (i.e., phosphorylation) of FOXO3 and its transcriptional control, and inhibition of both membrane and reticulum Ca2+ pumps (i.e., ATP2B1, ATP2A1, respectively).A new drug and its lack of toxicity “compound PI-7”, thus envisioning both preventive and therapeutic applications in patients with COVID-19.The specificity of action in the context of Ca2+ homeostasis is one of the strategies that coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2 and any new VOC, including Omicron 2) use to infect host cells and promote organ dysfunction.Therapeutic applications for compound PI-7 against all other viruses belonging to the Coronoviridae family (e.g., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), and against the main families of positive sense ssRNA viruses from other hosts (e.g., Nidovirales), as these are all Ca2+ dependent.Identification of a rare homozygous intronic variant in the ATP2B1 locus (rs11337717; chr12:89643729, T&gt;C) that is associated with severity of COVID19 (i.e., symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients). This variant can be used as a marker to identify those patients that might show severe COVID19 following their SARS-COV-2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the project CEINGE TaskForce COVID19, code D64I200003800 by Regione Campania for the fight against COVID19 (DGR no. 140; 17 March 2020).

%X BACKGROUND The rising breakthrough infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, especially Omicron and its sub-lineages, have raised an urgent need to develop broad-spectrum vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have developed a mosaic-type recombinant vaccine candidate, named NVSI-06-09, having immune potentials against a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variants.METHODS An ongoing randomized, double-blind, controlled phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of NVSI-06-09 as a booster dose in subjects aged 18 years and older from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who had completed two or three doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccinations at least 6 months prior to the enrollment. The participants were randomly assigned with 1:1 to receive a booster dose of NVSI-06-09 or BBIBP-CorV. The primary outcomes were immunogenicity and safety against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, and the exploratory outcome was cross-immunogenicity against other circulating strains.RESULTS A total of 516 participants received booster vaccination. Interim results showed a similar safety profile between NVSI-06-09 and BBIBP-CorV booster groups, with low incidence of adverse reactions of grade 1 or 2. For immunogenicity, by day 14 after the booster vaccination, the fold rises in neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) from baseline level elicited by NVSI-06-09 were remarkably higher than those by BBIBP-CorV against the prototype strain (19.67 vs 4.47-fold), Omicron BA.1.1 (42.35 vs 3.78-fold), BA.2 (25.09 vs 2.91-fold), BA.4 (22.42 vs 2.69-fold), and BA.5 variants (27.06 vs 4.73-fold). Similarly, the neutralizing GMTs boosted by NVSI-06-09 against Beta and Delta variants were also 6.60-fold and 7.17-fold higher than those boosted by BBIBP-CorV.CONCLUSIONS A booster dose of NVSI-06-09 was well-tolerated and elicited broad-spectrum neutralizing responses against SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain and immune-evasive variants, including Omicron and its sub-lineages. The immunogenicity of NVSI-06-09 as a booster vaccine was superior to that of BBIBP-CorV.

%X Background T cells are important in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2, but scalable and field-adaptable alternatives to expert T cell assays are needed. The interferon-gamma release assay QuantiFERON platform was developed to detect T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 from whole blood with relatively basic equipment and flexibility of processing timelines.Methods 48 participants with different infection and vaccination backgrounds were recruited. Whole blood samples were analysed using the QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay in parallel with the well-established ‘Protective Immunity from T Cells in Healthcare workers’ (PITCH) ELISpot, which can evaluate spike-specific T cell responses.Aims The primary aims of this cross-sectional observational cohort study were to establish if the QuantiFERON SARS-Co-V-2 assay could discern differences between specified groups and to assess the sensitivity of the assay compared to the PITCH ELISpot.Findings The QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 distinguished acutely infected individuals (12-21 days post positive PCR) from naïve individuals (p&lt; 0.0001) with 100% sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 T cells, whilst the PITCH ELISpot had reduced sensitivity (62.5%) for the acute infection group. Sensitivity with QuantiFERON for previous infection was 12.5% (172-444 days post positive test) and was inferior to the PITCH ELISpot (75%).Although the QuantiFERON assay could discern differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals (55-166 days since second vaccination), the latter also had reduced sensitivity (55.5%) compared to the PITCH ELISpot (66.6%).Conclusion The QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay showed potential as a T cell evaluation tool soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection but has lower sensitivity for use in reliable evaluation of vaccination or more distant infection.Graphical abstract With the exception of acute infection group, the PITCH ELISpot S1+S2 had greater sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses compared with the QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay tube Ag3.Competing Interest StatementS.J.D declares fees as a Scientific Advisor to the Scottish Parliament on COVID-19.

%X Immune responses in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been of significant interest throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Lymphocyte-targeting immunotherapies including anti-CD20 treatments and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators attenuate antibody responses after vaccination. Evaluation of cellular responses after vaccination is therefore of particular importance in these populations. In this study, we analysed CD4 and CD8 T cell functional responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides in healthy controls and pwMS on five different DMTs by flow cytometry. Although pwMS on anti-CD20 and S1PR therapies had low antibody responses after both 2 and 3 vaccine doses, T cell responses in pwMS on anti-CD20 therapies were preserved after a third vaccination, even when additional anti-CD20 treatment was administered between vaccine doses 2 and 3. PwMS taking S1PR modulators had low detectable T cell responses in peripheral blood. CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern Delta and Omicron were lower than to the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 variant. Our results indicate the importance of assessing both cellular and humoral responses after vaccination and suggest that even in the absence of robust antibody responses vaccination can generate immune responses in pwMS.Competing Interest StatementMK reported receiving speaker honoraria from Novartis, Biogen, Merck and Sanofi outside the submitted work.

%X The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of infections and deaths worldwide, since it infected humans almost three years ago. Improvements of current assays and development of new rapid tests or to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 are urgent. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a rapid and propitious assay, allowing to detect both colorimetric and/or fluorometric nucleic-acid amplifications. This study describes the analytical and clinical evaluation of RT-LAMP assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, by designing LAMP primers targeting N (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein), RdRp (polyprotein), S (surface glycoprotein) and E (envelope protein) genes. The assay’s performance was compared with the gold-standard RT-PCR, yielding 94.6% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity. Among the tested primer sets, the ones for S and N genes had the highest analytical sensitivity, showing results in about 20 minutes. The colorimetric and fluorometric comparisons revealed that the latter is faster than the former. The limit of detection (LoD) of RT-LAMP reaction in both assays is 50 copies/µl of reaction mixture. However, the simple eye-observation advantage of the colorimetric assay (with a color change from yellow to red) serves a promising on-site point-of-care testing method anywhere, including, for instance, laboratory and in-house applications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is partly funded by Institute for Research and Medical Consultations (IRMC; 2020-IRMC-S-3) and Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) of Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University (IAU; COVID19-2020-026-IRMC).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University (IAU) gave ethical approval for this work.

%X Background The use of variant-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine as a booster is being evaluated to overcome reduced neutralisation of variants induced by the original SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and waning protection over time.Methods This is a phase one, prospective, randomized, and open-labeled trial to study the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose consisting of a subunit vaccine based on the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, MVC-COV1901 or its Beta version, MVC-COV1901-Beta. One-hundred and seven participants aged ≥18 and &lt;55 years, who received two or three prior doses of MVC-COV1901 vaccines, were enrolled and were to receive a booster dose of either 15 mcg of MVC-COV1901, 15 mcg or 25 mcg of MVC-COV1901-Beta in 1:1:1 ratio. The primary endpoints were the incidences of adverse events and immunogenicity of the booster dose from Visit 2 (the day of the booster) to Visit 5 (four weeks after the booster). Cellular immunity was also investigated with memory B cell (MBC) and T cell assays.Findings Adverse reactions after either MVC-COV1901 or MVC-COV1901-Beta booster doses after two or three doses of MVC-COV1901 were comparable and mostly mild and transient. At four weeks after the booster dose, participants with two prior doses of MVC-COV1901 exhibited numerically higher levels of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 or Beta variant than participants with three prior doses of MVC-COV1901 regardless of the type of booster used. However, compared to 15 mcg of MVC-COV1901, 25 mcg of MVC-COV1901-Beta significantly improved neutralising antibody titre against Beta variant and BA.4/BA.5 Omicron variant pseudoviruses. The booster dose also significantly increased the proportion of spike-specific MBCs, including those of Beta and Omicron variants.Interpretation MVC-COV1901-Beta can be effectively used as a booster dose against SARS-CoV-2, including the circulating BA.4/BA.5 Omicron variant.Funding Medigen Vaccine Biologics CorporationCompeting Interest StatementC.

%X SARS-CoV-2 mRNA booster vaccines provide protection from severe disease, eliciting strong immunity that is further boosted by previous infection. However, it is unclear whether these immune responses are affected by the interval between infection and vaccination. Over a two-month period, we evaluated antibody and B-cell responses to a third dose mRNA vaccine in 66 individuals with different infection histories. Uninfected and post-boost but not previously infected individuals mounted robust ancestral and variant spike-binding and neutralizing antibodies, and memory B cells. Spike-specific B-cell responses from recent infection were elevated at pre-boost but comparatively less so at 60 days post-boost compared to uninfected individuals, and these differences were linked to baseline frequencies of CD27lo B cells. Day 60 to baseline ratio of BCR signaling measured by phosphorylation of Syk was inversely correlated to days between infection and vaccination. Thus, B-cell responses to booster vaccines are impeded by recent infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Intramural Research Programs of the Vaccine Research Center and the Division of Intramural Research, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The IRB of the National Institutes of Health gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Quantifying variation of individual infectiousness is critical to inform disease control. Previous studies reported substantial heterogeneity in transmission of many infectious diseases (including SARS-CoV-2). However, those results are difficult to interpret since the number of contacts is rarely considered in such approaches. Here, we analyze data from 17 SARS-CoV-2 household transmission studies conducted in periods dominated by ancestral strains, in which the number of contacts was known. By fitting individual-based household transmission models to these data, accounting for number of contacts and baseline transmission probabilities, the pooled estimate suggests that the 20% most infectious cases have 3.1-fold (95% confidence interval: 2.2-4.2 fold) higher infectiousness than average cases, which is consistent with the observed heterogeneity in viral shedding. Household data can inform the estimation of transmission heterogeneity, which is important for epidemic management.One Sentence Summary In this study, variation of individual infectiousness is quantified. Potential sources of such variation, particularly heterogeneity of viral shedding is discussed.Competing Interest StatementBJC consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Moderna, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi Pasteur.

%X The serial interval distribution is used to approximate the generation time distribution, an essential parameter to predict the effective reproductive number “Rt”, a measure of transmissibility. However, serial interval distributions may change as an epidemic progresses rather than remaining constant. Here we show that serial intervals in Hong Kong varied over time, closely associated with the temporal variation in COVID-19 case profiles and public health and social measures that were implemented in response to surges in community transmission. Quantification of the variation over time in serial intervals led to improved estimation of Rt, and provided additional insights into the impact of public health measures on transmission of infections.One-Sentence Summary Real-time estimates of serial interval distributions can improve assessment of COVID-19 transmission dynamics and control.Competing Interest StatementBJC consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GSK, Moderna, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi Pasteur.

%X Co-infection of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus family, has been of importance since the beginning of the recent pandemic. As the upcoming flu season arrives in countries with ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, the need for preventive policy actions becomes more critical. We present a joint compartmental SEIRS-SIRS model for the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza and discuss the characteristics of the model, such as the basic reproduction number (R0) and cases of death and recovery. We implemented the model using 2020 to early 2021 data derived from global healthcare organizations and studied the impact of interventions and policy actions such as vaccination, quarantine, and public education. The VENSIM simulation of the model resulted in R0 = 7.5, which is higher than what was reported for the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination against COVID-19 dramatically slowed its spread and the co-infection of both diseases significantly, while other types of interventions had a limited impact on the co-dynamics of the diseases given our assumptions. These findings can help provide guidance as to which preventive policies would be most effective at the time of concurrent epidemics, and contributes to the literature as a novel model to simulate and analyze the co-circulation of respiratory pathogens in a compartmental setting that can further be used to study the co-infection of COVID-19 or similar respiratory infections with other diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe author(s) received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.Not ApplicableThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:N/AI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.Not ApplicableI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Rationale Although COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory tract infection, current antibody treatments are administered by systemic dosing. We hypothesize that inhaled delivery of a muco-trapping monoclonal antibody would provide a more effective and convenient treatment for COVID-19.Objective We investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of IN-006, a reformulation of regdanvimab, an approved intravenous treatment for COVID-19, for nebulized delivery by a handheld nebulizer.Methods A Phase 1 study was conducted in healthy volunteers. Study staff and participants were blinded to treatment assignment, except for pharmacy staff preparing the study drug. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. Exploratory outcomes were pharmacokinetic measurements of IN-006 in nasal fluid and serum.Results Twenty-three participants were enrolled and randomized across two single dose and one multiple dose cohorts. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs). All enrolled participants completed the study without treatment interruption or discontinuation. All treatment-emergent adverse events were transient, non-dose dependent, and were graded mild to moderate in severity. Nebulization was well tolerated and completed in a mean of 6 minutes in the high dose group. Mean nasal fluid concentrations of IN-006 in the multiple dose cohort were 921 µg/g of nasal fluid at 30 minutes after dosing and 5.8 µg/g at 22 hours. Mean serum levels in the multiple dose cohort peaked at 0.55 µg/mL at 3 days after the final dose.Conclusions IN-006 was well-tolerated and achieved concentrations in the respiratory tract orders of magnitude above its inhibitory concentration. These data support further clinical development of IN-006.Registration Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12621001235897Competing Interest StatementTM, LB, BF, MH, MB, MM, ZR, JW, FF, and JH are employees of Inhalon Biopharma / Mucommune and may hold shares in Inhalon Biopharma, inc.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has challenged the control of the COVID-19 pandemic even in highly vaccinated countries. While a second booster of mRNA vaccines improved the immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the humoral and cellular responses induced by a second booster of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have not been studied. In the context of a phase 3 clinical study, we report that a second booster of CoronaVac® increased the neutralizing response against the ancestral virus yet showed poor neutralization against the Omicron variant. Additionally, isolated PBMCs displayed equivalent activation of specific CD4+ T cells and IFN-γ production when stimulated with a mega-pool of peptides derived from the spike protein of the ancestral virus or the Omicron variant. In conclusion, a second booster dose of CoronaVac® does not improve the neutralizing response against the Omicron variant compared with the first booster dose, yet it helps maintaining a robust spike-specific CD4+ T cell response.Competing Interest StatementGZ and WM are SINOVAC Biotech employees and contributed to the conceptualization of the study (clinical protocol and eCRF design) and did not participate in the analysis or interpretation of the data presented in the manuscript.

%X Background There are few trials comparing homologous and heterologous third doses of COVID-19 vaccination with inactivated vaccines and mRNA vaccines.Methods We conducted an open-label randomized trial in adults &gt;=18 years of age who received two doses of inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac) or mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) &gt;=6 months earlier, randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive a third dose of either vaccine. We compared the reactogenicity, immunogenicity and cell-mediated immune responses, and assessed vaccine efficacy against infections during follow-up.Results We enrolled 219 adults who previously received two doses of CoronaVac and randomised to CoronaVac (“CC-C”, n=101) or BNT162b2 (“CC-B”, n=118) third dose; and 232 adults who previously received BNT162b2 and randomised to CoronaVac (“BB-C”, n=118) or BNT162b2 (“BB-B”, n=114). There were more frequent reports of mild reactions in recipients of third-dose BNT162b2, which generally subsided within 7 days. Antibody responses against the ancestral virus, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 subvariant by surrogate neutralization and PRNT50 were stronger for the recipients of a third dose of BNT162b2 over CoronaVac irrespective of prior vaccine type. CD4+ T cells boost only occurred in CoronaVac-primed arms. We did not identify differences in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses between arms. When Omicron BA.2 was circulating, we identified 58 infections with cumulative incidence of 15.3% and 15.4% in the CC-C and CC-B (p=0.93), and 16.7% and 14.0% in the BB-C and BB-B arms, respectively (p=0.56).Conclusions Similar levels of incidence of infection in each arm suggest all third dose combinations may provide similar degrees of protection against prevalent Omicron BA.2 infection, despite very weak antibody responses to BA.2 in the recipients of a CoronaVac third dose. Further research is warranted to identify appropriate correlates of protection for inactivated COVID-19 vaccines.Competing Interest StatementBJC consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Moderna, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi Pasteur.

%X As the SARS-COV-2 pandemic evolves, what is expected of vaccines extends beyond efficacy to include consideration of both durability and variant cross-reactivity. This report expands on previously reported immunogenicity results from a Phase 1 trial of an AS03-adjuvanted, plant-based coronavirus-like particle (CoVLP) displaying the spike (S) glycoprotein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus in healthy adults 18-49 years of age (NCT04450004). When humoral and cellular responses against the ancestral strain were evaluated 6 months post-second dose (D201), 100% of vaccinated individuals retained binding antibodies, and ∼95% retained neutralizing antibodies; interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) responses directed against the ancestral S protein were also still detectable in ∼94% and ∼92% of vaccinees respectively. Variant-specific, cross-reactive neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels were assessed at D42 and D201 using both live wild-type and pseudovirion assays (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) or the wild-type assay alone (Delta, Omicron). In the wild-type assay, broad cross-reactivity was detected against all variants at D42 (100% Alpha and Delta, 94% Beta and Gamma, 74% Omicron). At D201, cross-reactive antibodies were detectable in almost all participants against Alpha, Gamma and Delta variants (94%) and the Beta variant (83%) and in a smaller proportion against Omicron (44%). Results were similar in the pseudovirion assay (D42, 100% cross-reactivity to Alpha and Gamma variants, 95% to Beta variant, D201, 94% for Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants). These data suggest that two doses of 3.75 µg CoVLP+AS03 elicit a durable and cross-reactive response that persists for at least 6 months post-vaccination.Competing Interest StatementP. Gobeil, I.

%X Background The South African COVID-19 Modelling Consortium (SACMC) was established in late March 2020 to support planning and budgeting for COVID-19 related healthcare in South Africa. We developed several tools in response to the needs of decision makers in the different stages of the epidemic, allowing the South African government to plan several months ahead of time.Methods Our tools included epidemic projection models, several cost and budget impact models, and online dashboards to help government and the public visualise our projections, track case development and forecast hospital admissions. Information on new variants, including Delta and Omicron, were incorporated in real time to allow the shifting of scarce resources when necessary.Results Given the rapidly changing nature of the outbreak globally and in South Africa, the model projections were updated regularly. The updates reflected 1) the changing policy priorities over the course of the epidemic; 2) the availability of new data from South African data systems; and 3) the evolving response to COVID-19 in South Africa such as changes in lockdown levels and ensuing mobility and contact rates, testing and contact tracing strategies, and hospitalisation criteria. Insights into population behaviour required updates by incorporating notions of behavioural heterogeneity and behavioural responses to observed changes in mortality. We incorporated these aspects into developing scenarios for the third wave and developed additional methodology that allowed us to forecast required inpatient capacity. Finally, real-time analyses of the most important characteristics of the Omicron variant first identified in South Africa in November 2021 allowed us to advise policymakers early in the fourth wave that a relatively lower admission rate was likely.Conclusion The SACMC’s models, developed rapidly in an emergency setting and regularly updated with local data, supported national and provincial government to plan several months ahead of time, expand hospital capacity when needed, allocate budgets, and procure additional resources where possible. Across four waves of COVID-19 cases, the SACMC continued to serve the planning needs of the government, tracking waves and supporting the national vaccine rollout.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work of GMR and LJ on the SACMC was supported by USAID South Africa (EVIDENCE) and USAID (EQUIP).

%X Accurately estimating relative transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 variants remains a scientific and public health priority. Recent studies have used the sample proportions of different variants from genetic sequence data to describe variant frequency dynamics and relative transmission rates, but frequencies alone cannot capture the rich epidemiological behavior of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we extend methods for inferring the effective reproduction number of an epidemic using confirmed case data to jointly estimate variant-specific effective reproduction numbers and frequencies of cocirculating variants using cases and sequences across states in the US from January 2021 to March 2022. Our method can be used to infer structured relationships between effective reproduction numbers across time series allowing us to estimate fixed variant-specific growth advantages. We use this model to estimate the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest in the United States and estimate consistent growth advantages of particular variants across different locations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementMF is an ARCS Foundation scholar and was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant No.\ DGE-1762114.

%X Effective public-health measures and vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 require granular knowledge of population-level immune responses. We developed a Tripartite Automated Blood Immunoassay (TRABI) to assess the IgG response against the ectodomain and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein as well as the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. We used TRABI for continuous seromonitoring of hospital patients and healthy blood donors (n=72’222) in the canton of Zurich from December 2019 to December 2020 (pre-vaccine period). Seroprevalence peaked in May 2020 and rose again in November 2020 in both cohorts. Validations of results included antibody diffusional sizing and Western Blotting. Using an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed model, we found that antibodies waned with a half-life of 75 days, whereas the cumulative incidence rose from 2.3% in June 2020 to 12.2% in mid-December 2020 in the population of the canton of Zurich. A follow-up health survey indicated that about 10% of patients infected with wildtype SARS-CoV-2 sustained some symptoms at least twelve months post COVID-19 and up to the timepoint of survey participation. Crucially, we found no evidence for a difference in long-term complications between those whose infection was symptomatic and those with asymptomatic acute infection. The cohort of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2- infected subjects represents a resource for the study of chronic and possibly unexpected sequelae.Competing Interest StatementTPJK is a member of the board of directors of Fluidic Analytics.

%X Neutralizing antibody plays a key role in protective immunity against COVID-19. As increasingly distinct variants circulate, debate continues regarding the value of adding novel variants to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this study, we have analyzed live virus neutralization titers against WA1, Delta, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 in 187 hospitalized patients infected with Delta or Omicron strains. This information will be useful in selection of the SARS-CoV-2 strains to include in an updated vaccine. Our results show that unvaccinated Delta infected patients made a highly biased neutralizing antibody response towards the infecting Delta strain with slightly lower responses against the WA1 strain, but with strikingly lower titers against BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5. Delta infected patients that had been previously vaccinated with the WA1 containing COVID vaccine made equivalent responses to WA1 and Delta strains, but still had very low neutralizing antibody responses to Omicron strains. In striking contrast, both unvaccinated and vaccinated Omicron patients exhibited a more balanced ratio of Omicron virus neutralization compared to neutralization of ancestral strains. Interestingly, Omicron patients infected with BA.1 or BA.2 had detectable neutralizing antibody titers to BA.5, but these titers were lower than neutralization titers to BA.1 and BA.2. Taken together, these results suggest that inclusion of the Omicron BA.5 strain in a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would be beneficial in protection against the widely circulating BA.5 variant.Disclaimer The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project has been funded in part by grants (NIH P51OD011132, 3U19AI057266-17S1, 1U54CA260563, HHSN272201400004C, NIH/NIAID CEIRR under contract 75N93021C00017 to Emory University) from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH).

%X Since May 2022, monkeypox cases have been reported in non-endemic countries, and the disease was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Rapid identification of new cases is critical for outbreak control. Environmental surveillance can be used as a complementary tool for detecting pathogens circulating in communities. This study aimed to investigate whether Monkeypox DNA can be detected in wastewater from a transportation hub.Twenty samples were collected in Italy’s first airport in Rome and tested using published and modified real-time PCR assays targeting the G2R region (TFN gene), F3L, and N3R genes. Nested PCR assays were also used for confirmation by sequencing. Three samples tested positive by real-time PCR and/or by nested PCR, confirming the occurrence of the virus in the airport’s wastewater.Wastewater surveillance can be quickly adapted to investigate emerging threats and can be used to track the introduction and/or the diffusion of the Monkeypox virus in communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was partially supported by collaboration agreement EC G.A.

%X The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in extensive surveillance of the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Sequencing data generated as part of these efforts can also capture the diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus populations replicating within infected individuals. To assess this within-host diversity of SARS-CoV-2 we quantified low frequency (minor) variants from deep sequence data of thousands of clinical samples collected by a large urban hospital system over the course of a year. Using a robust analytical pipeline to control for technical artefacts, we observe that at comparable viral loads, specimens from patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 had a greater number of minor variants than samples from outpatients. Since individuals with highly diverse viral populations could be disproportionate drivers of new viral lineages in the patient population, these results suggest that transmission control should pay special attention to patients with severe or protracted disease to prevent the spread of novel variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project was supported in part by the Houston Methodist Academic Institute Infectious Diseases Fund, and federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. 75N93019C00076 (J.J.D.).

%X Background/Objectives People with obesity (PWO) face an increased risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19, including hospitalisation, ICU admission and death. Obesity has been seen to impair immune memory following vaccination against influenza, hepatitis B, tetanus, and rabies. Little is known regarding immune memory in PWO following COVID-19 adenovirus vector vaccination.Subjects/Methods We investigated SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in 50 subjects, five months following a two-dose primary course of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccination. We further divided our cohort into PWO (n=30) and matched controls (n=20). T cell (CD4+, CD8+) cytokine responses (IFNγ, TNFα) to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide pools were determined using multicolour flow cytometry.Results Circulating T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 were readily detected across our cohort, with robust responses to spike peptide stimulation across both T cell lines. PWO and controls had comparable levels of both CD4+ and CD8+ SARS-CoV-2 spike specific T cells. Polyfunctional T cells – associated with enhanced protection against viral infection – were detected at similar frequencies in both PWO and controls.Conclusions These data indicate that PWO who have completed a primary course of ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccination have robust, durable, and functional antigen specific T cell immunity that is comparable to that seen in people without obesity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by the National Childrens Research Centre and a philanthropic donation from the St Vincents Foundation.

%X The increasing frequency and magnitude of viral outbreaks in recent decades, epitomized by the current COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in an urgent need for rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods. Here, we present a methodology for virus detection and identification that uses a convolutional neural network to distinguish between microscopy images of single intact particles of different viruses. Our assay achieves labeling, imaging and virus identification in less than five minutes and does not require any lysis, purification or amplification steps. The trained neural network was able to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from negative clinical samples, as well as from other common respiratory pathogens such as influenza and seasonal human coronaviruses. Additionally, we were able to differentiate closely related strains of influenza, as well as SARS-CoV-2 variants. Single-particle imaging combined with deep learning therefore offers a promising alternative to traditional viral diagnostic and genomic sequencing methods, and has the potential for significant impact.Competing Interest StatementThis study was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance (NIHR200915), a partnership between the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the University of Oxford, and the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC).

%X To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 variants we isolated SARS-CoV-2 temporally during the pandemic starting with first appearance of virus in the Western hemisphere near Seattle, WA, USA, and isolated each known major variant class, revealing the dynamics of emergence and complete take-over of all new cases by current Omicron variants. We assessed virus neutralization in a first-ever full comparison across variants and evaluated a novel monoclonal antibody (Mab). We found that convalescence greater than 5-months provides little-to-no protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccination enhances immunity against variants with the exception of Omicron BA.1, and paired testing of vaccine sera against ancestral virus compared to Omicron BA.1 shows that 3-dose vaccine regimen provides over 50-fold enhanced protection against Omicron BA.1 compared to a 2-dose regimen. We also reveal a novel Mab that effectively neutralizes Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants over clinically-approved Mabs. Our observations underscore the need for continued vaccination efforts, with innovation for vaccine and Mab improvement, for protection against variants of SARS-CoV-2.Summary We isolated SARS-CoV-2 temporally starting with emergence of virus in the Western hemisphere. Neutralization analyses across all variant lineages show that vaccine-boost regimen provides protection against Omicron BA.1. We reveal a Mab that protects against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants.Competing Interest StatementDr. Chu reported consulting with Ellume, Pfizer, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Vindico CME, and Merck.

%X Background Monkeypox cases keep soaring in non-endemic’s countries and areas in the last few months, leading to the WHO declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The ongoing and coming festivals, parties and holidays gathering events are causing increased concerns about possible outbreaks.Methods We considered a hypothetical metropolitan city and modelled the transmission of monkeypox virus in humans in high-risk (HRG) and low-risk groups (LRG) using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and incorporated gathering events. Model simulations assessed how the current vaccination strategy combined with other public health measures can contribute to mitigating or halting outbreaks from mass gathering events.Results The risk of a monkeypox outbreak remains high on the occasion of mass gathering events in the absence of public health control measures. However, the outbreaks can be well controlled by cutting off transmission by isolating confirmed cases and inoculating their close contacts. Also, Post Exposure Prophylaxis is more effective for containment in the summer gatherings than a broad vaccination campaign in HRG, considering the time needed for developing the immune response and the availability of vaccine. The number of attendees and effective contacts during the gathering are the factors that need more attention by public health authorities to prevent a burgeoning outbreak. Moreover, restricting attendance through vaccination requirements can help secure mass gathering events.Conclusion Gathering events can be made safe with some restrictions of either the number and density of attendees in the gathering, or vaccination requirements. The ring vaccination strategy inoculating close contacts of confirmed cases may not be enough to prevent potential outbreaks, however, mass gatherings can be rendered safe if that strategy is combined with public health measures, including rigorous contact tracing, testing, identifying and isolating cases. Compliance of the community and promotion of awareness are also indispensable to the containment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada OMNI-REUNI network for the Emerging Infectious Disease Modelling Initiative (NSERC EIDM) (J.B., J.A., J.

%X Each novel SARS-CoV-2 variant renews concerns about decreased vaccine efficacy caused by evasion of vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies. However, accumulating epidemiological data show that while vaccine prevention of infection varies, protection from severe disease and death remains high. Thus, immune responses beyond neutralization could contribute to vaccine efficacy. Polyclonal antibodies function through their Fab domains that neutralize virus directly, and Fc domains that induce non-neutralizing host responses via engagement of Fc receptors on immune cells. To understand how vaccine induced neutralizing and non-neutralizing activities synergize to promote protection, we leverage sera from 51 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected health-care workers after two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. We show that BNT162b2 elicits antibodies that neutralize clinical isolates of wildtype and five variants of SARS-CoV-2, including Omicron BA.2, and, critically, induce Fc effector functions. FcγRIIIa/CD16 activity is linked to neutralizing activity and associated with post-translational afucosylation and sialylation of vaccine specific antibodies. Further, neutralizing and non-neutralizing functions diminish with age, with limited polyfunctional breadth, magnitude and coordination observed in those ≥65 years old compared to &lt;65. Thus, studying Fc functions in addition to Fab mediated neutralization provides greater insight into vaccine efficacy for vulnerable populations such as the elderly against SARS-CoV-2 and novel variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by a grant from the M.

%X The emergence of novel Omicron lineages, such as BA.5, may impact the therapeutic efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Here, we evaluated the neutralization and ADCC activity of 6 therapeutic mAbs against Delta, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 isolates. The Omicron sub-variants escaped most of the antibodies but remained sensitive to Bebtelovimab and Cilgavimab. Consistent with their shared spike sequence, BA.4 and BA.5 displayed identical neutralization profiles. Sotrovimab was the most efficient at eliciting ADCC. We also analyzed 121 sera from 40 immunocompromised individuals up to 6 months after infusion of 1200 mg of Ronapreve (Imdevimab + Casirivimab), and 300 or 600 mg of Evusheld (Cilgavimab + Tixagevimab). Sera from Ronapreve-treated individuals did not neutralize Omicron subvariants. Evusheld-treated individuals neutralized BA.2 and BA.5, but titers were reduced by 41- and 130-fold, respectively, compared to Delta. A longitudinal evaluation of sera from Evusheld-treated patients revealed a slow decay of mAb levels and neutralization. The decline was more rapid against BA.5. Our data shed light on the antiviral activities of therapeutic mAbs and the duration of effectiveness of Evusheld pre-exposure prophylaxis.Competing Interest StatementT.B., C.P., H.M. and O.S. have a pending patent application for an anti-RBD mAb not used in this study (PCT/FR2021/070522).

%X In mid-2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant caused the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries worldwide. The pivotal studies were aimed at studying changes in the efficiency of neutralizing antibodies to the spike protein. However, much less attention was paid to the T-cell response and the presentation of virus peptides by MHC-I molecules. In this study, we compared the features of the HLA-I genotype in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 in the first and third waves of the pandemic. As a result, we could identify the vanishing of carriers of the HLA-A*01:01 allele in the third wave and demonstrate the unique properties of this allele. Thus, HLA-A*01:01-binding immunoprevalent epitopes are mostly derived from ORF1ab. A set of epitopes from ORF1ab was tested, and their high immunogenicity was confirmed. Moreover, analysis of the results of single-cell phenotyping of T-cells in recovered patients showed that the predominant phenotype in HLA-A*01:01 carriers is central memory T-cells. The predominance of T-lymphocytes of this phenotype may contribute to forming long-term T-cell immunity in carriers of this allele.

%X The recent outbreak of monkeypox (MPXV) outside its endemic boundaries has attracted global attention and prompted world leaders to reserve millions of doses of the only approved third-generation smallpox/MPXV vaccine, Jynneos, which is based on the highly attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector. We previously developed COH04S1, a multiantigen SARS-CoV-2 vaccine built on a synthetic MVA (sMVA) platform. COH04S1 was extensively tested for efficacy and immunogenicity in animal models, including non-human primates (NHP), and was found to be safe and to induce SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adults. Here we demonstrate that one or two vaccinations of NHP with either COH04S1 or sMVA elicit robust othopoxvirus-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses. Furthermore, healthy adults vaccinated with COH04S1 at different dose levels develop robust othopoxvirus-specific humoral and cellular immune responses that are durable for over six months post-vaccination. Importantly, both COH04S1 and sMVA vaccinations induce elevated and sustained antibody responses to MPXV-proteins that are major targets of protective neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate that COH04S1 and sMVA are valuable vaccine candidates to stimulate robust orthopox/MPXV-specific humoral and cellular immunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04639466Funding StatementThe Carol Moss Foundation provided funding for this study.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:IRB of the City of Hope National Medical Center gave full ethical approval of this work under COHIRB#20447.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Targeted surveillance allows public health authorities to implement testing and isolation strategies when diagnostic resources are limited. When transmission patterns are determined by social contact rates, the consideration of social network topologies in testing schemes is one avenue for targeted surveillance, specifically by prioritizing those individuals likely to contribute disproportionately to onward transmission. Yet, it remains unclear how to implement such surveillance and control when network data is unavailable, as is often the case in resource-limited settings. We evaluated the efficiency of a testing strategy that targeted individuals based on their degree centrality on a social network compared to a random testing strategy in the context of low testing capacity. We simulated SARS-CoV-2 dynamics on two contact networks from rural Madagascar and measured the epidemic duration, infection burden, and tests needed to end the epidemics. In addition, we examined the robustness of this approach when individuals’ true degree centralities were unknown and were instead estimated via readily-available socio-demographic variables (age, gender, marital status, educational attainment, and household size). Targeted testing reduced the infection burden by between 5 - 50% at low testing capacities, while requiring up to 28% fewer tests than random testing. Further, targeted tested remained more efficient when the true network topology was unknown and prioritization was based on socio-demographic characteristics, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach under realistic conditions. Incorporating social network topology into epidemic control strategies is an effective public health strategy for health systems suffering from low testing capacity and can be implemented via socio-demographic proxies when social networks are unknown.*French abstract available in Supplemental MaterialsCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, a NIH-SSF-NIFA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease Award (No. 1R01-TW011493-01), and a Duke University Provost's Collaboratory grant Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Duke University (protocol no. 2019-0560) and Malagasy Ethics Panel (137 MSNP/SG/AGMED/CERBM du 26 aout 2020) approved the survey protocols used in this study.

%X There is a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines, with less than 20% of eligible populations in low-income countries having received one dose. Intradermal delivery of fractional dose vaccines is one way to improve global vaccine access, but no studies have reported data on intradermal delivery of COVID-19 primary series vaccination. We conducted a pilot study to examine the safety and immunogenicity of three intradermal primary series regimens – heterologous regimen of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1 (CoronaVac-ChAdOx1), homologous regimen of ChAdOx1 (ChAdOx1-ChAdOx1), and homologous regimen of BNT162b2 (BNT162b2-BNT162b2). Each dose was 1/5th or 1/6th of the standard dose. Two additional exploratory arms of intradermal vaccination for the second dose following an intramuscular first dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 were included. Intradermal vaccination was found to be immunogenic and safe. The antibody responses generated by the intradermal primary series were highest in the BNT162b2 arms. The anti-receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) IgG concentration following fractional dose intradermal vaccination was similar to that of standard dose intramuscular vaccination of the same regimen, except for BNT162b2. The BNT162b2 intradermal series generated a lower antibody concentration than the reference intramuscular series, despite generating the highest antibody concentration of all three intradermal primary series regimens. Neutralizing antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain were consistent with what was observed for anti-RBD IgG, with lower titers for SARS-CoV-2 variants. The FRNT50 titers were lowest against the omicron variant, being undetectable (GMT≤10) in about a quarter of study participants. T-cell responses against spike- and nucleocapsid-membrane-open reading frame proteins were also detected following intradermal vaccination. Adverse effects following intradermal vaccination were generally comparable with post-intramuscular vaccination effects. Taken together, our data suggest that intradermal vaccination using 1/5th or 1/6th of standard COVID-19 intramuscular vaccination dosing generates similar immune responses with tendency of lower systemic adverse reactions than intramuscular vaccination. Our findings have implications in settings where COVID-19 vaccines are in shortage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThai Clinical Trial Registry (TCTR20210903006)Funding StatementThis study was supported by Health Systems Research Institute, Thailand.

%X Background Hong Kong has enforced stringent travel restrictions particularly for inbound travellers since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the characteristics of imported COVID-19 cases is important for establishing evidence-based control measures.Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study to summarise the characteristics of cases classified as imported cases that were detected on or soon after arrival into Hong Kong from 13 November 2020 through to 31 January 2022, when all arriving persons were required to quarantine in a hotel or a designated quarantine facility. We analysed individual demographics, and clinical information including symptoms and disease severity, virus variants, and Ct values.Results There were 2269 imported COVID-19 cases aged 0-85 years identified in Hong Kong. Almost half (48.6%) of the imported cases were detected on arrival. A shorter median delay from arrival to isolation was observed in Delta and Omicron cases (3 days) than cases infected with the ancestral strain and other variants (12 days; p&lt;0.001) while lower Ct values at isolation were observed in cases infected with Omicron than the ancestral strain or other variants. No Omicron cases were detected beyond 14 days after arrival, and the cases (n=58, 2.6%) detected after 14 days of quarantine more frequently presented without symptoms at isolation and had a higher RT-PCR Ct-value during isolation. At least some of these cases were post-arrival infections.Conclusions Testing inbound travellers at arrival and during on-arrival quarantine can detect imported cases early although it may not be sufficient to prevent all introductions of COVID-19 into the community. Public health measures should be adjusted in responses to the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 based on the epidemiologic evidence from continuous surveillance.Competing Interest StatementBJC consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Moderna, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi Pasteur.

%X SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in the development of a constellation of persistent sequelae following acute disease called post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or Long COVID1–3. Individuals diagnosed with Long COVID frequently report unremitting fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and a variety of cognitive and autonomic dysfunctions1–3; however, the basic biological mechanisms responsible for these debilitating symptoms are unclear. Here, 215 individuals were included in an exploratory, cross-sectional study to perform multi-dimensional immune phenotyping in conjunction with machine learning methods to identify key immunological features distinguishing Long COVID. Marked differences were noted in specific circulating myeloid and lymphocyte populations relative to matched control groups, as well as evidence of elevated humoral responses directed against SARS-CoV-2 among participants with Long COVID. Further, unexpected increases were observed in antibody responses directed against non-SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogens, particularly Epstein-Barr virus. Analysis of circulating immune mediators and various hormones also revealed pronounced differences, with levels of cortisol being uniformly lower among participants with Long COVID relative to matched control groups. Integration of immune phenotyping data into unbiased machine learning models identified significant distinguishing features critical in accurate classification of Long COVID, with decreased levels of cortisol being the most significant individual predictor. These findings will help guide additional studies into the pathobiology of Long COVID and may aid in the future development of objective biomarkers for Long COVID.Competing Interest StatementIn the past three years, H.K. received expenses and/or personal fees from UnitedHealth, Element Science, Aetna, Reality Labs, Tesseract/4Catalyst, F-Prime, the Siegfried and Jensen Law Firm, Arnold and Porter Law Firm, and Martin/Baughman Law Firm.

%X Background Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for reduction of transmission and clinical decision-making. The cobas® SARS-CoV-2 &amp; Influenza A/B nucleic acid test for use on the cobas Liat® System is a rapid (20 minutes) point-of-care (POC) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.Methods This unblinded, pre-post study enrolled consecutive patients with symptoms/signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting to the University of California, Davis emergency department (ED). Outcomes following implementation of the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 &amp; Influenza A/B test (intervention period: December 2020–May 2021) were compared with previous standard-of-care using centralized laboratory PCR methods (control period: April 2020–October 2020).Results Electronic health records of 8879 symptomatic patients were analyzed, comprising 4339 and 4540 patient visits and 538 and 638 positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results in the control and intervention periods, respectively. Compared with the control period, turnaround time (TAT) was shorter in the intervention period (median 0.98 vs 12.3 hours; p&lt;0.0001). ED length of stay (LOS) was generally longer in the intervention period compared with the control period, but for those SARS-CoV-2-negative who were admitted, ED LOS was shorter (median 12.53 vs 17.93 hours; p&lt;0.0001). Overall, the rate of anti-infective prescribing was also lower in the intervention period than in the control period (antibiotics only: 38.11% vs 44.55%; p&lt;0.0001 and antivirals only: 3.13% vs 0.94%; p&lt;0.0001).Conclusion This real-world study confirms faster TAT with a POC PCR method in an emergency care setting and highlights the importance of rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection to aid patient management and inform treatment decisions.Clinical Relevance This study reports data collected from a quasi-experimental pre-post study using the electronic health records of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) of the University of California at Davis Medical Center with symptoms or signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection during their ED visit. The primary objective of this study was to determine if implementation of the point-of-care (POC) cobas® Liat® SARS-CoV-2 &amp; Influenza A/B test for use on the cobas Liat System reduced the diagnostic turnaround time and/or length of stay for ED patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the previous standards of care (batch-wise diagnostic testing using the cobas 6800 System and on-demand urgent testing on the GenMark Dx® ePlex® system in a centralized clinical laboratory).

%X Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), an emerging approach for community-wide COVID-19 surveillance, was primarily characterized at large sewersheds such as wastewater treatment plants serving a large population. Although informed public health measures can be better implemented for a small population, WBE for neighborhood-scale sewersheds is less studied and not fully understood. This study applied WBE to seven neighborhood-scale sewersheds (average population of 1,471) from January to November, 2021. Community testing data showed an average of 0.004% incidence rate in these sewersheds (97% of monitoring periods reported two or fewer daily infections). In 92% of sewage samples, SARS-CoV-2 N gene fragments were below the limit of quantification. We statistically determined 10-2.6 as the threshold of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene concentration normalized to pepper mild mottle virus (N/PMMOV) to alert high COVID-19 incidence rate in the studied sewershed. This threshold of N/PMMOV identified neighborhood-scale outbreaks (COVID-19 incidence rate higher than 0.2%) with 82% sensitivity and 51% specificity. Importantly, neighborhood-scale WBE can discern local outbreaks that would not otherwise be identified by city-scale WBE. Our findings suggest that neighborhood-scale WBE is an effective community-wide disease surveillance tool when COVID-19 incidence is maintained at a low level.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe Grainger College of Engineering and the JUMP-ARCHES program of OSF Healthcare in conjunction with the University of Illinois.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study used only openly available clinical COVID-19 testing data that were originally located at: https://www.c-uphd.org/covid-case-and-testing-data.htmlI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The development of vaccines to control the COVID-19 pandemic progression is a worldwide priority. CoronaVac® is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approved for emergency use with robust efficacy and immunogenicity data reported in trials in China, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and Chile.Methods This study is a randomized, multicenter, and controlled phase 3 trial in healthy Chilean adults aged ≥18 years. Volunteers received two doses of CoronaVac® separated by two (0-14 schedule) or four weeks (0-28 schedule). 2,302 volunteers were enrolled, 440 were part of the immunogenicity arm, and blood samples were obtained at different times. Samples from a single center are reported. Humoral immune responses were evaluated by measuring the neutralizing capacities of circulating antibodies. Cellular immune responses were assessed by ELISPOT and flow cytometry. Correlation matrixes were performed to evaluate correlations in the data measured.Results Both schedules exhibited robust neutralizing capacities with the response induced by the 0-28 schedule being better. No differences were found in the concentration of antibodies against the virus and different variants of concern between schedules. Stimulation of PBMCs with MPs induced the secretion of IFN-γ and the expression of activation induced markers for both schedules. Correlation matrixes showed strong correlations between neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ secretion.Conclusions Immunization with CoronaVac® in Chilean adults promotes robust cellular and humoral immune responses. The 0-28 schedule induced a stronger humoral immune response than the 0-14 schedule.Funding Ministry of Health, Government of Chile, Confederation of Production and Commerce &amp; Millennium Institute on Immunology and Immunotherapy, Chile.Clinical trial number NCT04651790.summary Two immunization schedules were evaluated for the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Coronavac®, with two doses of the vaccine separated by two or four weeks.

%X Background The generation time distribution, reflecting the time between successive infections in transmission chains, is one of the fundamental epidemiological parameters for describing COVID-19 transmission dynamics. However, because exact infection times are rarely known, it is often approximated by the serial interval distribution, reflecting the time between illness onsets of infector and infectee. This approximation holds under the assumption that infectors and infectees share the same incubation period distribution, which may not always be true.Methods We analyzed data on observed incubation period and serial interval distributions in China, during January and February 2020, under different sampling approaches, and developed an inferential framework to estimate the generation time distribution that accounts for variation over time due to changes in epidemiology, sampling biases and public health and social measures.Results We analyzed data on a total of 2989 confirmed cases for COVID-19 during January 1 to February 29, 2020 in Mainland China. During the study period, the empirical forward serial interval decreased from a mean of 8.90 days to 2.68 days. The estimated mean backward incubation period of infectors increased from 3.77 days to 9.61 days, and the mean forward incubation period of infectees also increased from 5.39 days to 7.21 days. The estimated mean forward generation time decreased from 7.27 days (95% confidence interval: 6.42, 8.07) to 4.21 days (95% confidence interval: 3.70, 4.74) days by January 29. We used simulations to examine the sensitivity of our modelling approach to a number of assumptions and alternative dynamics.Conclusions The proposed method can provide more reliable estimation of the temporal variation in the generation time distribution, enabling proper assessment of transmission dynamics.Competing Interest StatementB.J.C. consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GSK, Moderna, Pfizer, Roche, and Sanofi Pasteur.

%X COVID-19 vaccines are playing a vital role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. As SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding mutations in the surface glycoprotein, Spike, continue to emerge, there is increased need to identify immunogens and vaccination regimens that provide the broadest and most durable immune responses. We compared the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response, as well as levels of Spike-reactive memory B cells, in individuals receiving a second dose of BNT126b2 at a short (3-4 week) or extended interval (8-12 weeks) and following a third vaccination approximately 6-8 months later. We show that whilst an extended interval between the first two vaccinations can greatly increase the breadth of the immune response and generate a higher proportion of Spike reactive memory B cells, a third vaccination leads to similar levels between the two groups. Furthermore, we show that the third vaccine dose enhances neutralization activity against omicron lineage members BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 and this is further increased following breakthrough infection during the UK omicron wave. These findings are relevant for vaccination strategies in populations where COVID-19 vaccine coverage remains low.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by; Huo Family Foundation Award to MHM and KJD, MRC Genotype–to–Phenotype UK National Virology Consortium ([MR/W005611/1] to MHM and KJD), Fondation Dormeur, Vaduz for funding equipment to KJD, Wellcome Trust Investigator Award [222433/Z/21/Z] to MHM, and Wellcome Trust Multi–User Equipment Grant [208354/Z/17/Z] to MHM. and KJD.

%T Impact of age-structure and vaccine prioritization on COVID-19 in West Africa

%X The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a major global health challenge since its emergence in 2019. Contrary to early predictions that sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) would bear a disproportionate share of the burden of COVID-19 due to the region’s vulnerability to other infectious diseases, weak healthcare systems, and socioeconomic conditions, the pandemic’s effects in SSA have been very mild in comparison to other regions. Interestingly, the number of cases, hospitalizations, and disease-induced deaths in SSA remain low, despite the loose implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and the low availability and administration of vaccines. Possible explanations for this low burden include epidemiological disparities, under-reporting (due to limited testing), climatic factors, population structure, and government policy initiatives. In this study, we formulate a model framework consisting of a basic model (in which only susceptible individuals are vaccinated), a vaccine-structured model, and a hybrid vaccine-age-structured model to reflect the dynamics of COVID-19 in West Africa (WA). The framework is trained with a portion of the confirmed daily COVID-19 case data for 16 West African countries, validated with the remaining portion of the data, and used to (i) assess the effect of age structure on the incidence of COVID-19 in WA, (ii) evaluate the impact of vaccination and vaccine prioritization based on age brackets on the burden of COVID-19 in the sub-region, and (iii) explore plausible reasons for the low burden of COVID-19 in WA compared to other parts of the world. Calibration of the model parameters and global sensitivity analysis show that asymptomatic youths are the primary drivers of the pandemic in WA. Also, the basic and control reproduction numbers of the hybrid vaccine-age-structured model are smaller than those of the other two models indicating that the disease burden is overestimated in the models which do not account for age-structure. This result is also confirmed through the vaccine-derived herd immunity thresholds. In particular, a comprehensive analysis of the basic (vaccine-structured) model reveals that if 84% (73%) of the West African populace is fully immunized with the vaccines authorized for use in WA, vaccine-derived herd immunity can be achieved. This herd immunity threshold is lower (68%) for the hybrid model. Also, all three thresholds are lower (60% for the basic model, 51% for the vaccine-structured model, and 48% for the hybrid model) if vaccines of higher efficacies (e.g., the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine) are prioritized, and higher if vaccines of lower efficacy are prioritized. Simulations of the models show that controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in WA (by reducing transmission) requires a proactive approach, including prioritizing vaccination of more youths or vaccination of more youths and elderly simultaneously. Moreover, complementing vaccination with a higher level of mask compliance will improve the prospects of containing the pandemic. Additionally, simulations of the model predict another COVID-19 wave (with a smaller peak size compared to the Omicron wave) by mid-July 2022. Furthermore, the emergence of a more transmissible variant or easing the existing measures that are effective in reducing transmission will result in more devastating COVID-19 waves in the future. To conclude, accounting for age-structure is important in understanding why the burden of COVID-19 has been low in WA and sustaining the current vaccination level, complemented with the WHO recommended NPIs is critical in curbing the spread of the disease in WA.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCNN acknowledges the support of the Simons Foundation (Award #627346) and the National Science Foundation (GrantNumber: DMS #2151870).

%X Background To strategically develop preventive and therapeutic measures against coronavirus disease 2019 and its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, it is critical to fully characterize immune response and sustained immune activation following viral infection and vaccination. However, the mechanisms controlling intrapersonal variation in antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 antigens remain unclear. To gain further insights into how we can optimize therapeutic and preventive care, we performed a robust molecular and cellular investigation of immune responses in infected, recovered, and vaccinated individuals.Methods We evaluated the expression of 29 cytokines and assessed their correlation with neutralizing potency. We further investigated memory B-cell response in patients infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain or other variants of concern, and in vaccinated individuals.Results Correlation analyses showed that the relationship between neutralizing activity and cytokine expression differed according to disease severity and viral strain. Furthermore, long-term longitudinal analyses revealed that post-vaccination neutralizing potential was more strongly associated with various cytokine expression levels in recovered patients than in naïve individuals. Notably, we found a similar distribution of virus-specific antibody gene families in triple-vaccinated individuals and a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia for one year.Conclusion Our results showed that distinct immune responses occur depending on the viral strain suggesting that therapeutic options should be selected on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses revealed biomarker candidates that correlated with repeated vaccination that may be applicable to therapies regulating specific immune responses and novel monoclonal antibodies.Funding This work was supported by the Institutional Funds, YOKOYAMA Foundation for Clinical Pharmacology (#YRY-2121), and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/ Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) KAKENHI; Grant-in-Aid for Early-Career Scientists (#21K15888).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd., Japan, YOKOYAMA Foundation for Clinical Pharmacology (#YRY-2121), and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)/The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Early-Career Scientists (grant number 21K15888).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of Juntendo University School of Medicine gave ethical approval for this work (IRB #21-017, #M21-0017).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Rapid antigen tests play an important role in the monitoring and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it provides an easy, fast and efficient diagnosis with minimum infrastructure requirements. However, as new variants of concern continue to emerge, mutations in the virus genome may impair the recognition of the mutated antigen by the tests. Therefore, it is essential to re-assess the test’s sensitivity as the virus mutation profile undergoes significant changes. Here, we prospectively accessed the performance of the DPP® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test in the context of an omicron-dominant real-life setting. We evaluated 347 unselected individuals (all-comers) from a public testing center in Brazil, performing the rapid antigen test diagnosis at point-of-care with fresh samples. The combinatory result from two distinct RT-qPCR methods was employed as reference and 13 samples with discordant PCR results were excluded. The assessment of the rapid test in 67 PCR-positive and 265 negative samples revealed an overall sensitivity of 80.5%, specificity of 99.2% and positive/negative predictive values higher than 95%. However, we observed that the sensitivity was dependent on the viral load (sensitivity in Ct&lt;31 = 93.7%; Ct&gt;31 = 47.4%). Furthermore, we were able to confirm that the positive samples evaluated in the study were Omicron (BA.1/BA.1.1) by whole-genome sequencing (n=40) and multiplex RT-qPCR (n=17).

%X The NVX-CoV2373-vaccine has recently been licensed, although data on vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immunity towards the parental strain and variants of concern (VOCs) in comparison to dual-dose mRNA-regimens are limited. In this observational study including 66 participants, we show that NVX-CoV2373-induced IgG-levels were lower than after vaccination with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (n=22 each, p=0.006). Regardless of the vaccine and despite different IgG-levels, neutralizing activity towards VOCs was highest for Delta, followed by BA.2 and BA.1. Interestingly, spike-specific CD8 T-cell levels after NVX-CoV2373-vaccination were significantly lower and were detectable in 3/22 (14%) individuals only. In contrast, spike-specific CD4 T-cells were induced in 18/22 (82%) individuals. However, CD4 T-cell levels were lower (p&lt;0.001), had lower CTLA-4 expression (p&lt;0.0001) and comprised less multifunctional cells co-expressing IFNγ, TNFαα and IL-2 (p=0.0007) as compared to mRNA-vaccinated individuals. Unlike neutralizing antibodies, NVX-CoV2373-induced CD4 T cells cross-reacted to all tested VOCs from Alpha to Omicron, which may hold promise to protect from severe disease.Competing Interest StatementM.S. has received grant support from Astellas and Biotest to the organization Saarland University outside the submitted work, and honoraria for lectures from Biotest and Novartis.

%X Resident memory T cells (TRM) present at the respiratory tract may be essential to enhance early SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance, thus limiting viral infection and disease. While long-term antigen (Ag)-specific TRM are detectable beyond 11 months in the lung of convalescent COVID-19 patients after mild and severe infection, it is unknown if mRNA vaccination encoding for the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein can induce this frontline protection. We found that the frequency of CD4+ T cells secreting interferon (IFN)γ in response to S-peptides was variable but overall similar in the lung of mRNA-vaccinated patients compared to convalescent-infected patients. However, in vaccinated patients, lung responses presented less frequently a TRM phenotype compared to convalescent infected individuals and polyfunctional CD107a+ IFNγ+ TRM were virtually absent. Thus, a robust and broad TRM response established in convalescent-infected individuals may be advantageous in limiting disease if the virus is not blocked by initial mechanisms of protection, such as neutralization. Still, mRNA vaccines might induce responses within the lung parenchyma, potentially contributing to the overall disease control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by grants from Fundacio La Marato TV3 (201814-10 FMTV3 and 202112-30 FMTV3), from the Health department of the Government of Catalonia (DGRIS 1_5), and the Spanish AIDS network Red Tematica Cooperativa de Investigacion en SIDA (RD16/0025/0007).

%X The concurrent timing of the COVID-19 pandemic and the seasonal occurrence of influenza, makes it especially important to analyze the possible effect of the influenza vaccine on the risk of contracting COVID-19, or in reducing the complications caused by both diseases, especially in vulnerable populations. There is very little scientific information on the possible protective role of the influenza vaccine against the risk of contracting COVID-19, particularly in groups at high-risk of influenza complications. Reducing the risk of contracting COVID-19 in high-risk patients (those with a higher risk of infection, complications, and death) is essential to improve public well-being and to reduce hospital pressure and the collapse of primary health centers. Apart from overlapping in time, COVID-19 and flu share common aspects of transmission, so that measures to protect against flu might be effective in reducing the risk of contracting COVID-19.In this study, we conclude that the risk of contracting COVID-19 is reduced if patients are vaccinated against flu, but the reduction is small (0.22%) and therefore not clinically important. When this reduction is analysed based on the risk factor suffered by the patient, statistically significant differences have been obtained for patients with cardiovascular problems, diabetics, chronic lung and chronic kidney, in all four cases the reduction in the risk of contagion does not reach 1%.It is worth highlighting the behaviour that is completely different from the rest of the data for institutionalized patients. The data for these patients does not suggest a reduction in the risk of contagion for patients vaccinated against the flu, but rather the opposite, a significant increase of 6%.Socioeconomic conditions, as measured by the MEDEA deprivation index, explain increases in the risk of contracting COVID-19, and awareness campaigns should be increased to boost vaccination programs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The project had the approval of the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Institut d'Investigació en Atenció Primària (IDIAP) Jordi Gol (reference 20/242-PCV).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Many SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants have acquired mutations conferring phenotypes such as increased transmissibility or virulence, or causing diagnostic, therapeutic, or immune escape. Detection of Alpha and the majority of Omicron sublineages by PCR relied on the so-called S gene target failure due to the deletion of six nucleotides coding for amino acids 69-70 in the spike (S) protein. Detection of hallmark mutations in other variants present in samples relied on whole genome sequencing. However, whole genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is still in its infancy due to geographic inequities in sequencing capabilities, higher cost compared to other molecular assays, longer turnaround time from sample to result, and technical challenges associated with producing complete genome sequences from samples that have low viral load and/or high background. Hence, there is a need for rapid genotyping assays. In order to rapidly generate information on the presence of a variant in a given sample, we have created a panel of four triplex RT-qPCR assays targeting 12 mutations to detect and differentiate all five variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. We also developed an expanded pentaplex assay that can reliably distinguish among the major sublineages (BA.1-BA.5) of Omicron. In silico, analytical and clinical testing of the variant panel indicate that the assays overall exhibit high sensitivity and specificity. This variant panel can be used as a Research Use Only screening tool for triaging SARS-CoV-2 positive samples prior to whole genome sequencing.Competing Interest StatementCompeting interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: no support from any organization for the submitted work other than those described in the Funding section; no financial relationships with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years other than the reported author affiliations (which include employees of Biomeme, Inc.); no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.Funding StatementFunding for this study was provided by the Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND), in collaboration with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) COVID funding initiative for this effort: Development of a Biomeme Variant Panel under the Contract (FA807518D0017) with MRIGlobal, and a Subcontract (867-111084-20) between MRIGlobal and Biomeme, Inc.

%X One of the significant challenges, when a new virus circulates in a host population, is to detect the outbreak as it arises in a timely fashion and implement the appropriate preventive policies to effectively halt the spread of the disease. The conventional computational epidemic models provide a state-space representation of the dynamic changes of various sub-clusters of a society based on their exposure to the virus and are mostly developed for small-size epidemics. In this work, we reshape and reformulate the conventional computational epidemic modeling approach based on the complex temporal behavior of disease propagation in host populations, inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our new proposed framework allows the construction of transmission rate (p) as a probabilistic function of contributing factors such as virus mutation, immunity waning, and immunity resilience. Our results unravel the interplay between transmission rate, vaccination, virus mutation, immunity loss, and their indirect impacts on the endemic states and waves of the spread. The proposed model provides a robust mathematical framework that allows policy-makers to improve preparedness for curtailing an infectious disease and unfolds the optimal time-frame for vaccination given the available resources and the probability of virus mutation for the current and unforeseen outbreaks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe material presented in this work is supported by US National Science Foundation (NSF), Awards 2208189, and 2031594.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background More than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, it is generally assumed that most of the population has developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from infection and/or vaccination. However, public health decision-making is hindered by the lack of up-to-date and precise characterization of the immune landscape in the population. We thus aimed to estimate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seroprevalence and cross-variant neutralization capacity after Omicron became dominant in Geneva, Switzerland.Methods We conducted a population-based serosurvey between April 29th and June 9th, 2022, recruiting children and adults of all ages from age-stratified random samples of the Geneva general population. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody presence was assessed using commercial immunoassays targeting either the spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) protein. Antibodies neutralization capacity against different SARS-CoV-2 variants was evaluated using a cell-free Spike trimer-ACE2 binding-based surrogate neutralization assay. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and neutralization capacity were estimated using Bayesian modeling frameworks accounting for the demographics, vaccination, and infection statuses of the Geneva population.Results Among the 2521 individuals included in the analysis (55.2% women; 21.4% aged &lt;18 years and 14.2% aged ≥ 65 years), overall seroprevalence of antibodies was 93.8% (95% credible interval: 93.1-94.5), including 72.4% (70.0-74.7) for infection-induced antibodies. Estimates of neutralizing antibodies based on a representative subsample of 1160 participants ranged from 79.5% (77.1-81.8) against the Alpha variant to 46.7% (43.0-50.4) against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants. Despite having high seroprevalence of infection-induced antibodies (76.7% [69.7-83.0] for ages 0-5 years, 90.5% [86.5-94.1] for ages 6-11 years), children aged &lt;12 years had substantially lower neutralizing activity than older participants, particularly against Omicron subvariants. In general, higher levels of neutralization activity against pre-Omicron variants were associated with vaccination, particularly having received a booster dose. Higher levels of neutralization activity against Omicron subvariants were associated with booster vaccination alongside recent infection.Conclusion More than nine in ten individuals in the Geneva population have developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through vaccination and/or infection, but less than half of the population has antibodies with neutralizing activity against the currently circulating Omicron BA.5 subvariant. Hybrid immunity obtained through booster vaccination and infection appears to confer the greatest neutralization capacity, including against Omicron.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the General Directorate of Health of the Department of Safety, Employment and Health of the canton of Geneva, the Private Foundation of the Geneva University Hospitals, the CoVICIS grant from the European Commission, and a private foundation advised by CARIGEST SA.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Geneva Cantonal Commission for Research Ethics approved this study (Project number 2020-00881).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Intradermal vaccination using fractional dosage of the standard vaccine dose is one strategy to improve access to COVID-19 immunization. We conducted a pilot study in healthy adults in Thailand to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of intradermal administration of fractional dose of ChAdOx1 (1/5th of standard dosage) or BNT162b2 (1/6th of standard dosage) to individuals previously vaccinated (prime) with two-dose intramuscular CoronaVac, ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2. Following an initial immunogenicity exploratory phase for each vaccine combination group (N=10), a total of 135 participants (N=45 per group) were recruited to three groups (CoronaVac prime-intradermal BNT162b2 boost, CoronaVac prime-intradermal ChAdOx1 boost and ChAdOx1 prime-intradermal BNT162b2 boost) and their immunogenicity data compared to a previous cohort who received the same vaccine intramuscularly. Two weeks following booster vaccination, neutralizing antibodies against the delta variant were similar between intradermal and intramuscular vaccination. However, neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant in the intradermal BNT162b2 boost groups were ∼6-fold lower, while the ChAdOx1 boost group was ∼5-fold higher compared to their respective vaccine regimen given intramuscularly. The intradermal booster significantly increased spike-specific T cell responses in all three groups from pre-booster levels. Local and systemic adverse reactions were milder in intradermal compared to intramuscular injections. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings and the feasibility of administration of intradermal COVID-19 vaccines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialTCTR20210907003 and TCTR20211102006Funding StatementThis study was supported by Health Systems Research Institute, Thailand.

%X Since the first reports of hepatitis of unknown aetiology occurring in UK children, over 1000 cases have been reported worldwide, including 268 cases in the UK, with the majority younger than 6 years old. Using genomic, proteomic and immunohistochemical methods, we undertook extensive investigation of 28 cases and 136 control subjects. In five cases who underwent liver transplantation, we detected high levels of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) in the explanted livers. AAV2 was also detected at high levels in blood from 10/11 non-transplanted cases. Low levels of Adenovirus (HAdV) and Human Herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B), both of which enable AAV2 lytic replication, were also found in the five explanted livers and blood from 15/17 and 6/9 respectively, of the 23 non-transplant cases tested. In contrast, AAV2 was detected at low titre in 6/100 whole bloods from child controls from cohorts with presence or absence of hepatitis and/or adenovirus infection. Our data show an association of AAV2 at high titre in blood or liver tissue, with unexplained hepatitis in children infected in the recent HAdV-F41 outbreak. We were unable to find evidence by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry or proteomics of HAdV or AAV2 viral particles or proteins in explanted livers, suggesting that hepatic pathology is not due to direct lytic infection by either virus. The potential that AAV2, although not previously associated with disease, may, together with HAdV-F41 and/or HHV-6, be causally implicated in the outbreak of unexplained hepatitis, requires further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work was funded by UKHSA, the National Institute for Health Research and Wellcome Trust.

%X The effectiveness of interventions such as public mask-wearing, contact tracing, and vaccination presents an important lesson for control of the further COVID-19 outbreaks without of whole country lockdowns and the restriction of individual movement. We simulated different scenarios of COVID-19 waves in Taiwan from 2020 to the beginning of March 2022 and considered the following interventions: travel restrictions, quarantine of infected individuals, contact tracing, mask-wearing, vaccination, and mass gathering restrictions. We propose an epidemiological compartmental model modified from the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model and derive a formula for the basic reproduction number (R0) describing its dependence on all investigated parameters. The simulation results are fitted with the official Taiwanese COVID-19 data. Thus, the results demonstrate that the fast introduction of the interventions and maintaining them at a high level are able the outbreak control without strict lockdowns. By estimation of the R0, it was shown that it is necessary to maintain on high implementation level of both non- and pharmaceutical intervention types to control the COVID-19 transmission. Our results can be useful as advice or recommendation for public health policies, and our model can be applied for other epidemiological simulation studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan, grant number BN-109-PP-08, and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, grant number MOST 106 2115 M 400 001.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Long-term immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including neutralizing antibodies and T cell-mediated immunity, is required in a very large majority of the population in order to reduce ongoing disease burden. We have investigated the association between memory CD4 and CD8 T cells and levels of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent COVID-19 subjects. Higher titres of convalescent neutralizing antibodies were associated with significantly higher levels of RBD-specific CD4 T cells, including specific memory cells that proliferated vigorously in vitro. Conversely, up to half of convalescent individuals had low neutralizing antibody titres together with a lack of receptor binding domain (RBD)- specific memory CD4 T cells. These low antibody subjects had other, non-RBD, spike-specific CD4 T cells, but with more of an inhibitory Foxp3+ and CTLA-4+ cell phenotype, rather than the effector T- bet+, cytotoxic granzymes+ and perforin+ cells seen in high antibody subjects. Single cell transcriptomics of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells from high antibody subjects revealed heterogenous RBD-specific CD4+ T cells that comprised central memory, transitional memory and Tregs, as well as cytotoxic clusters containing diverse TCR repertoires, that were absent in individuals with low antibody levels. However, vaccination in low antibody convalescent individuals led to a slight but significant improvement in RBD-specific memory CD4 T cells and increased neutralizing antibody titres. Our results suggest that targeting CD4 T cell epitopes proximal to and within the RBD- region should be prioritized in booster vaccines.One Sentence Summary Individuals with low neutralising antibody titres may be at risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection due to a failure to generate a high quality CD4 T cell response specific for receptor binding domain (RBD), including memory CD4 T cells that proliferate in vitro in response to RBD, and which are also therefore an important target for vaccine design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSt Vincents Clinic Foundation Grant Medical Research Future Fund Grant National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Program Grant ID1149990 (ADK) NHMRC Fellowship ID1155678 (TGP) UNSW Cellular Genomics Futures Institute Seed Funding (WHK) Mrs Janice Gibson and the Ernest Heine Family Foundation (PIC and TGP) Garvan Institute COVID Catalytic Grant (TGP) UNSW COVID-19 Rapid Response Research Initiative (TGP) Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The ADAPT study was approved by the St Vincents Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (2020/ETH00964) and is a registered trial (ACTRN12620000554965) ADAPT-C sub study was approved by the same committee (2020/ETH01429) All data were stored using REDCap electronic data capture tools.

%X Since early 2022, Omicron BA.1 has been eclipsed by BA.2, which was in turn outcompeted by BA.5, that displays enhanced antibody escape properties. Here, we evaluated the duration of the neutralizing antibody (Nab) response, up to 16 months after Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination, in individuals with or without BA.1/BA.2 breakthrough infection. We measured neutralization of the ancestral D614G lineage, Delta and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.5 variants in 291 sera and 35 nasal swabs from 27 individuals. Upon vaccination, serum Nab titers were reduced by 10-, 15-and 25-fold for BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5, respectively, compared with D614G. The duration of neutralization was markedly shortened, from an estimated period of 11.5 months post-boost with D614G to 5.5 months with BA.5. After breakthrough, we observed a sharp increase of Nabs against Omicron subvariants, followed by a plateau and a slow decline after 4-5 months. In nasal swabs, infection, but not vaccination, triggered a strong IgA response and a detectable Omicron neutralizing activity. Thus, BA.5 spread is partly due to abbreviated vaccine efficacy, particularly in individuals who were not infected with previous Omicron variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWork in OS lab is funded by: Institut Pasteur Urgence COVID-19 Fundraising Campaign of Institut Pasteur Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM) ANRS Vaccine Research Institute (ANR10LABX77) Labex IBEID (ANR10LABX62IBEID) ANR/FRM Flash Covid PROTEOSARSCoV2 ANR Coronamito and IDISCOVR.

%X Background Data from previous studies of the MVC-COV1901 vaccine, a subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 based on the stable prefusion spike protein (S-2P) adjuvanted with CpG 1018 adjuvant and aluminum hydroxide, suggest that the vaccine is generally safe and elicits a good immune response in healthy adults and adolescents. By comparing with AZD1222, this study adds to the findings from previous trials and further evaluates the breadth of protection offered by MVC-COV1901.Methods In this phase 3, parallel group, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Paraguay, we assigned adults aged 18 to 91 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive intramuscular doses of MVC-COV1901 or AZD1222 administered as scheduled in the clinical trial. Serum samples were collected on the day of vaccination and 14 days after the second dose. Primary and secondary safety and immunogenicity endpoints were assessed. In addition, other outcomes investigated were cross-reactive immunity against the Omicron strain and the induction of IgG subclasses.Results A total of 1,030 participants underwent randomization. Safety data was derived from this set while primary immunogenicity data involved a per-protocol immunogenicity (PPI) subset including 225 participants. Among the participants, 58% are seropositive at baseline. When compared against AZD1222, MVC-COV1901 exhibited superiority in terms of neutralizing antibody titers and non-inferiority in terms of seroconversion rates. Reactogenicity was generally mild and no serious adverse event was attributable to MVC-COV1901. Both vaccines have a Th1-biased response predominated by the production of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. Omicron-neutralizing titers were 44.5 times lower compared to wildtype-neutralizing titers among seronegative individuals at baseline. This fold-reduction was 3.0 times among the seropositive.Conclusion Results presented here demonstrate the safe and robust immunogenicity from MVC-COV1901. Previous infection coupled with vaccination of this vaccine may offer protection against the Omicron strain though its durability is still unknown.ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT05011526Competing Interest StatementM.-Y.

%X Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza share similar symptoms, which hampers diagnosis. Given that they require different containment and treatment strategies, fast and accurate distinction between the two infections is needed. This study evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 &amp; Flu A/B Test for simultaneous detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A/B from a single nasal swab.Methods Nasal samples were collected from patients as part of the ASPIRE (NCT04557046) and INSPIRE (NCT04288921) studies at point-of-care testing sites in the USA. ASPIRE study participants were included after developing COVID-19 symptoms in the last 14 days or following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the last 48 hours. INSPIRE study participants were included after developing influenza symptoms in the last 4 days. Samples were extracted into proprietary buffer and analysed using the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 &amp; Flu A/B Test. A reference sample was taken from each subject, placed into universal transport medium and tested using reference SARS-CoV-2 and influenza reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. The test and reference samples were compared using the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA), together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results Analysis of the data from the ASPIRE (N=124) and INSPIRE (N=159) studies revealed high levels of agreement between the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 &amp; Flu A/B Test and the reference tests in detecting SARS-CoV-2 (PPA=95.5% [95% CI: 84.9%, 98.7%]; NPA=96.0% [95% CI: 90.9%, 98.3%]), influenza A (PPA=83.3% [95% CI: 66.4%, 92.7%]; NPA=97.7% [95% CI: 93.4%, 99.2%]) and influenza B (PPA=80.0% [95% CI: 62.7%, 90.5%]; NPA=95.3% [95% CI: 90.2%, 97.9%]).Conclusions The LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 &amp; Flu A/B Test shows a high agreement with the reference RT-PCR tests while simultaneously detecting and differentiating between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B.Trial registration, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04557046 and NCT04288921Competing Interest StatementJayne Ellis is a consultant to LumiraDx.

%T Mathematical assessment of the role of waning and boosting immunity against the BA.1 Omicron variant in the United States
%D 2022

%X Three safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines) have played a major role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. However, the effectiveness of these vaccines and vaccination programs has been challenged by the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. A new mathematical model is formulated to assess the population-level impact of the waning and boosting of vaccine-derived and natural immunity against the Omicron variant in the United States. To account for gradual waning of vaccine-derived immunity, we considered three vaccination classes (V1, V2 and V3; where subscripts 1, 2 and 3 represent high, moderate and low levels of immunity, respectively). The disease-free equilibrium of the model was shown to be globally-asymptotically stable, for two special cases, whenever a certain associated epidemiological quantity, known as the vaccination reproduction number of the model, is less than one. The model was fitted using observed daily case data for the Omicron BA.1 variant in the United States. Simulations of the resulting parameterized model showed that, for the case where the high-level of the vaccine-derived protective efficacy received by individuals in the first vaccinated class (V1) is set at its baseline value (85%; while the vaccine-protective efficacy for individuals in the V2 and V3 classes, as well as natural immunity, are maintained at baseline), population-level herd immunity can be achieved in the United States via vaccination-boosting strategy, if at least 59% of the susceptible populace is fully-vaccinated followed by the boosting of about 71.5% of the fully-vaccinated individuals whose vaccine-derived immunity has waned to moderate or low level. However, if the high level of vaccine-induced efficacy for individuals in the V1 class is reduced to 55%, for instance, achieving herd immunity requires fully-vaccinating at least 91% of the susceptible population (followed by marginal boosting of those in whom the vaccine-derived immunity has waned to moderate or low level). In the absence of boosting of vaccine-derived and natural immunity, waning of immunity (both vaccine-derived and natural) only causes a marginal increase in the average number of new cases at the peak of the pandemic. Boosting of both immunity types at baseline could result in a dramatic reduction in the average number of daily new cases at the peak, in comparison to the corresponding waning scenario without boosting of immunity. Furthermore, boosting of vaccine-derived immunity (at baseline) is more beneficial (in reducing the burden of the pandemic) than boosting of natural immunity (at baseline). Specifically, for the fast waning of immunity scenario (where both vaccine-derived and natural immunity are assumed to wane within three months), boosting vaccine-derived immunity at baseline reduces the average number of daily cases at the peak by 90% (in comparison to the corresponding scenario without boosting of the vaccine-derived immunity), whereas boosting of natural immunity (at baseline) only reduced the corresponding peak daily cases (in comparison to the corresponding scenario without boosting of natural immunity) by 62%. It was further shown that boosting of vaccine-derived (implemented near the baseline level) increased the prospects of altering the trajectory of COVID-19 from persistence to possible elimination (even for the fast waning scenario of vaccine-derived immunity). Thus, a vaccination strategy that emphasizes boosting of immunity would significantly enhance the prospects of SARS-CoV-2 elimination in the United States.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Despite the plethora of efficacious vaccines to the initial Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2, these do not induce robust mucosal immunity, offering limited protection against breakthrough infection and replication in the respiratory tract. The mucosa is the first line of defense, therefore a vaccine that induces a mucosal IgA response could be an important strategy in curbing the global pandemic.Methods We conducted a single-site, dose-ranging, open-label clinical trial of an oral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to determine safety and immunogenicity. This tablet vaccine is comprised of a non-replicating adenoviral vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid genes and a double-stranded RNA adjuvant. 35 adult subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria received a single low (1×1010 IU) or high (5×1010 IU) dose and 5 subjects received two low doses. Nasal, saliva and serum samples were assessed for the presence of IgA, IgG and surrogate neutralizing antibodies. Convalescent subjects between 1-8 months post infection were recruited to give nasal, saliva, and serum samples for comparison.Results The vaccine was well tolerated without any dose-limiting toxicity observed. No serum neutralizing antibodies were observed, but modest IgA responses were seen in serum post immunization. The majority of vaccine recipients had an increase in mucosal secretory IgA which was highly cross-reactive against all coronaviruses tested and persisted up to 360 days. Furthermore, the nasal IgA induced by vaccination has superior neutralizing activity compared to convalescent nasal samples.Conclusion The vaccine was safe, well tolerated and generated mucosal immune responses including cross-reactive surrogate neutralizing secretory IgA. These results demonstrate the ability of a mucosal vaccine to induce long-lasting mucosal IgA to SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are employees of Vaxart, Inc., and have received stock options and compensation as part of their employment.Clinical TrialNCT04563702Funding StatementThis study did not receive any external fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was conducted in accordance with applicable Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the United States Code of Federal Regulations, and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines.

%X The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe health, economic, and societal impacts across the globe. Although highly efficacious vaccines were developed at an unprecedented rate, the heterogeneity in vaccinated populations has reduced the ability to achieve herd immunity. Specifically, as of Spring 2022, the 0–4 year-old population is still unable to be vaccinated and vaccination rates across 5-11 year olds are low. Additionally, vaccine hesitancy for older populations has further stalled efforts to reach herd immunity thresholds. This heterogeneous vaccine landscape increases the challenge of anticipating disease spread in a population. We developed an age-structured Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-type mathematical model to investigate the impacts of unvaccinated subpopulations on herd immunity. The model considers two types of undervaccination - age-related and behavior-related - by incorporating four age groups based on available FDA-approved vaccines. The model accounts for two different types of vaccines, mRNA (e.g., Pfizer, Moderna) and vector (e.g., Johnson and Johnson), as well as their effectiveness. Our goal is to analyze different scenarios to quantify which subpopulations and vaccine characteristics (e.g., rate or efficacy) most impact infection levels in the United States, using the state of New Mexico as an example.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is approved for distribution under LA-UR-22-2591.

%X Introduction Third doses of COVID-19 vaccination provide an important boost to immunity, reducing the risk of symptomatic infection and the risk of severe disease. Third doses have been particularly important for improving protection against variants. However, waning of clinical protection particularly against Omicron has been noted after receipt of third doses.Methods We administered BNT162b2 as a third dose to adults aged ≥30 years who had previously received two doses of inactivated vaccination. We collected blood before the third dose and again after one month and six months, and tested sera using a spike receptor binding domain IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a surrogate virus neutralization test, and live virus plaque reduction neutralization assay against ancestral virus and Omicron BA.2.Results We administered BNT162b2 as a third dose to 314 adults. We found robust antibody responses to the ancestral strain at six months after receipt of BNT162b2. Antibody responses to Omicron BA.2 were weaker after the third dose and had declined to a low level by six months. From a small number of participants we observed that natural infection or a fourth dose of vaccination generated similar antibody levels against ancestral virus, but infection generated higher antibody level against Omicron BA.2 than vaccination, suggesting a potential advantage in the breadth of antibody response from hybrid immunity.Conclusions While antibody levels against the ancestral strain remained robust at six months after the third dose, antibody levels against Omicron BA.2 had fallen to low levels suggesting the potential benefits of a fourth dose.Competing Interest StatementBJC consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Moderna, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi Pasteur.

%X Background Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been deployed broadly as an early warning tool for emerging COVID-19 outbreaks. WBE can inform targeted interventions and identify communities with high transmission, enabling quick and effective response. As wastewater becomes an increasingly important indicator for COVID-19 transmission, more robust methods and metrics are needed to guide public health decision making.Objectives The aim of this research was to develop and implement a mathematical framework to infer incident cases of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 levels measured in wastewater. We propose a classification scheme to assess the adequacy of model training periods based on clinical testing rates and assess the sensitivity of model predictions to training periods.Methods We present a Bayesian deconvolution method and linear regression to estimate COVID-19 cases from wastewater data. We described an approach to characterize adequacy in testing during specific time periods and provided evidence to highlight the importance of model training periods on the projection of cases. We estimated the effective reproductive number (Re) directly from observed cases and from the reconstructed incidence of cases from wastewater. The proposed modeling framework was applied to three Northern California communities served by distinct wastewater treatment plants.Results Both deconvolution and linear regression models consistently projected robust estimates of prevalent cases and Re from wastewater influent samples when assuming training periods with adequate testing. Case estimates from models that used poorer-quality training periods consistently underestimated observed cases.Discussion Wastewater surveillance data requires robust statistical modeling methods to provide actionable insight for public health decision-making. We propose and validate a modeling framework that can provide estimates of COVID-19 cases and Re from wastewater data that can be used as tool for disease surveillance including quality assessment for potential training data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by the Healthy Central Valley Together (HCVT) and Healthy Davis Together (HDT) programs at the University of California, Davis.

%X A large proportion of the global population received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine as priming vaccination, which was shown to provide protection against moderate to severe COVID-19. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that harbor immune-evasive mutations in the spike protein led to the recommendation of booster vaccinations after Ad26.COV2.S priming. Recent studies showed that heterologous booster vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine following Ad26.COV2.S priming leads to high antibody levels. However, how heterologous booster vaccination affects other functional aspects of the immune response remains unknown. Here, we performed immunological profiling on samples obtained from Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated individuals before and after a homologous (Ad26.COV2.S) or heterologous (mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2) booster vaccination. Both homologous and heterologous booster vaccination increased antibodies with multiple functionalities towards ancestral SARS-CoV-2, the Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants. Especially, mRNA-based booster vaccination induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and antibodies with various Fc-mediated effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. In contrast, T cell responses were similar in magnitude following homologous or heterologous booster vaccination, and retained functionality towards Delta and Omicron BA.1. However, only heterologous booster vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine led to the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell clones, without an increase in the breadth of the T cell repertoire as assessed by T cell receptor sequencing. In conclusion, we show that Ad26.COV2.S priming vaccination provides a solid immunological base for heterologous boosting with an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, increasing humoral and cellular responses targeting newly emerging variants of concern.One sentence summary Ad26.COV2.S priming provides a solid immunological base for extension of cellular and humoral immune responses following an mRNA-based booster.Competing Interest StatementA.S. is a consultant for Gritstone Bio, Flow Pharma, ImmunoScape, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Avalia, Fortress, Repertoire, Gilead, Gerson Lehrman Group, RiverVest, MedaCorp, and Guggenheim.

%X The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the World to a near standstill for most of 2020 and 2021, causing chaos in international travel, driving many economies into the ground, particularly those largely based on tourism. The lack of standard tools to assist decision makers in structuring a coherent policy to allow foreign passengers into their county and the resulting panic-mode opening/closing the borders on every “new case” outburst or new variant “of concern”, have led several countries to costly and often meaningless decisions based on fear rather than science or logic. This study aims at providing a universal method to safely keep the borders open and allow conditional immigration to foreign passengers according to a “Risk Group” table that includes all the countries reporting data on their Covid-19 situation to the WHO and other organisms. The RG table is recalculated on a weekly basis according to a mathematical model described in this paper, dynamically assessing the status of the pandemic worldwide through the calculation of a “Safety Index” for each country. A prototype algorithm has been implemented in VBA/EXCEL and its results are published bi-weekly on a Github repository.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In the absence of a systematic approach to epidemiological modeling in Slovenia, various isolated mathematical epidemiological models emerged shortly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. We present an epidemiological model adapted to the COVID-19 situation in Slovenia. The standard SEIR model was extended to distinguish between age groups, symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression, and vaccinated or unvaccinated populations. Evaluation of the model forecasts for 2021 showed the expected behavior of epidemiological modeling: our model adequately predicts the situation up to 4 weeks in advance; the changes in epidemiologic dynamics due to the emergence of a new viral variant in the population or the introduction of new interventions cannot be predicted by the model, but when the new situation is incorporated into the model, the forecasts are again reliable. Comparison with ensemble forecasts for 2022 within the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub showed better performance of our model, which can be explained by a model architecture better adapted to the situation in Slovenia, in particular a refined structure for vaccination, and better parameter tuning enabled by the more comprehensive data for Slovenia. Our model proved to be flexible, agile, and, despite the limitations of its compartmental structure, heterogeneous enough to provide reasonable and prompt short-term forecasts and possible scenarios for various public health strategies.

%X We characterize variant diversity, amino acid mutation frequency, functionality and associations with COVID-19 infections in one of the largest datasets of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from wastewater in the New York metropolitan area. Variant diversity differed within parts of the New York City sewershed and between wastewater sludge and influent samples. P314L, D614G and T3255I occurred in &gt;95% of wastewater samples. Enhanced infectivity, transmissibility and escape from antibody neutralization were dominant traits in the wastewater. Strikingly, over 60% of the most frequently occurring mutations were found in regions other than the spike (S) protein, and nearly 50% remain uncharacterized for functional impacts warranting further investigation. We demonstrate strong correlations between P314L, D614G, T95I, G50E, G50R, G204R, R203K, G662S, P10S, P13L and mortality rates, percent positive test results, hospitalization rates and % of population fully vaccinated. The results from our study suggest that there are relatively understudied mutations in the spike protein (H655Y, T95I) and understudied mutations occurring in non-spike proteins (N, ORF1b, ORF9b and ORF9c), that are enhancing transmissibility and infectivity among human populations, warranting further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research is supported by the National Science Foundation (CBET 2026599) and the National Institutes of Health (U01DA053949).

%X Environmental surveillance (ES) of a pathogen is crucial for understanding the community load of disease. As an early warning system, ES for SARS-CoV-2 has complemented routine diagnostic surveillance by capturing near real-time virus circulation at a population level. In this longitudinal study in 28 sewershed sites in Bangalore city, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA to track infection dynamics and provide evidence of change in the relative abundance of emerging variants. We describe an early warning system using the exponentially weighted moving average control chart and demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater correlated with clinically diagnosed new COVID-19 cases, with the trends appearing 8–14 days earlier in wastewater than in clinical data. This was further corroborated by showing that the estimated number of infections is strongly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies detected in the wastewater. Using a deconvolution matrix, we detected emerging variants of concern up to two months earlier in wastewater samples. In addition, we found a huge diversity in variants detected in wastewater compared to clinical samples. Our study highlights that quantifying viral titres, correlating it with a known number of cases in the area, and combined with genomic surveillance helps in tracking VOCs over time and space, enabling timely and making informed policy decisions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work has been supported by funding from the Rockefeller Foundation grant to National Centre for Biological Sciences (TIFR) and the Indian Council of Medical Research grant to (FI) Tata Institute for Genetics and Society and Tata Trusts.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Haemodialysis patients are at-risk for severe COVID-19 and were among the first to receive a fourth COVID-19 vaccination.Methods We analysed humoral responses by multiplex-based IgG measurements against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and ACE2-binding inhibition towards variants of concern including Omicron in haemodialysis patients and controls after triple BNT162b2 vaccination and in dialysis patients after a fourth full-dose of mRNA-1273. T-cell responses were assessed by interferon γ release assay.Findings After triple BNT162b2 vaccination, anti-RBD B.1 IgG and ACE2 binding inhibition reached peak levels in dialysis patients, but remained inferior compared to controls. Whilst we detected B.1-specific ACE2 binding inhibition in 84% of dialysis patients after three BNT162b2 doses, binding inhibition towards the Omicron variant was only 38% and declining to 16% before the fourth vaccination. By using mRNA-1273 as fourth dose, humoral immunity against all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested was strongly augmented with 80% of dialysis patients having Omicron-specific ACE2 binding inhibition. Modest declines in T-cell responses in dialysis patients and controls after the second vaccination were restored by the third BNT162b2 dose and significantly increased by the fourth vaccination.Conclusions A fourth full-dose mRNA-1273 after triple BNT162b2 vaccination in haemodialysis patients leads to efficient humoral responses against Omicron. Our data support current national recommendation and suggest that other immune-impaired individuals may benefit from this mixed mRNA vaccination regimen.Funding Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres, EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, State Ministry of Baden-Württemberg for Economic Affairs, Labour and Tourism, European Regional Development FundEvidence before this study Information on how to best maintain immune protection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in at-risk individuals for severe COVID-19 such as haemodialysis patients is limited. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for keywords such as “haemodialysis”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, “decay”, “antibody kinetics”, “cellular immunity”, “longitudinal vaccination response”, “immunisation scheme”. To date, no peer-reviewed studies comprehensively assessed impact of both cellular and humoral immunogenicity after a triple BNT162b2 vaccination in combination with a fourth full-dose of mRNA-1273 and addressed the impact of currently dominating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern on vaccine-induced immunity in this at-risk population.Added value of the study We provide to the best of our knowledge for the first time longitudinal vaccination response data over the course of the pandemic in dialysis patients. We studied not only systemic T- and B-cell but also mucosal responses in this at-risk group and determined levels of neutralizing antibodies towards Omicron BA.1 and Delta variants after a mixed mRNA vaccine schedule.Implications of all the available evidence Patients on haemodialysis show inferior response rates and thus a more rapid decline in humoral immune response after triple vaccination with BNT162b2. Our data strongly support the concept of administering a fourth full-dose of mRNA-1273 as part of a heterologous vaccination scheme to boost immunity and to prevent severe COVID-19 within this at-risk population. Strategic application of modified vaccine regimens may be an immediate response against SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased immune evasion potential.Competing Interest StatementNSM was a speaker at Luminex user meetings in the past.

%X The effectiveness of control interventions against COVID-19 is threatened by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We present a mathematical model for studying the transmission dynamics of two of these variants (Delta and Omicron) in the United States, in the presence of vaccination, treatment of individuals with clinical symptoms of the disease and the use of face masks. The model is parameterized and cross-validated using observed daily case data for COVID-19 in the United States for the period from November 2021 (when Omicron first emerged) to March 2022. Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium of the model is locally-asymptotically stable when the control reproduction number of the model (denoted by ℝc) is less than one. This equilibrium is shown to be globally-asymptotically stable for a special case of the model, where disease-induced mortality is negligible and both vaccine-derived immunity in fully-vaccinated individuals and natural immunity do not wane, when the associated reproduction number is less than one. The epidemiological implication of the latter result is that the combined vaccination-boosting strategy can lead to the elimination of the pandemic if its implementation can bring (and maintain) the associated reproduction number to a value less than one. An analytical expression for the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold is derived. Using this expression, together with the baseline values of the parameters of the parameterized model, we showed that the vaccine-derived herd immunity can be achieved in the United States (so that the pandemic will be eliminated) if at least 68% of the population is fully-vaccinated with two of the three vaccines approved for use in the United States (Pfizer or Moderna vaccine). Furthermore, this study showed (as of the time of writing in March 2022) that the control reproduction number of the Omicron variant was approximately 3.5 times that of the Delta variant (the reproduction of the latter is computed to be ≈ 0.2782), indicating that Delta had practically died out and that Omicron has competitively-excluded Delta (to become the predominant variant in the United States). Based on our analysis and parameterization at the time of writing of this paper (March 2022), our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 elimination is feasible by June 2022 if the current baseline level of the coverage of fully-vaccinated individuals is increased by about 20%. The prospect of pandemic elimination is significantly improved if vaccination is combined with a face mask strategy that prioritizes moderately effective and high-quality masks. Having a high percentage of the populace wearing the moderately-effective surgical mask is more beneficial to the community than having low percentage of the populace wearing the highly-effective N95 masks. We showed that waning natural and vaccine-derived immunity (if considered individually) offer marginal impact on disease burden, except for the case when they wane at a much faster rate (e.g., within three months), in comparison to the baseline (estimated to be within 9 months to a year). Treatment of symptomatic individuals has marginal effect in reducing daily cases of SARS-CoV-2, in comparison to the baseline, but it has significant impact in reducing daily hospitalizations. Furthermore, while treatment significantly reduces daily hospitalizations (and, consequently, deaths), the prospects of COVID-19 elimination in the United States are significantly enhanced if investments in control resources are focused on mask usage and vaccination rather than on treatment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The last three years have been spent combating COVID-19, and governments have been seeking optimal solutions to minimize the negative impacts on societies. Although two types of testing have been performed for this—follow-up testing for those who had close contact with infected individuals and mass-testing of those with symptoms—the allocation of resources has been controversial. Mathematical models such as the susceptible, infectious, exposed, recovered, and dead (SEIRD) model have been developed to predict the spread of infection. However, these models do not consider the effects of testing characteristics and resource limitations. To determine the optimal testing strategy, we developed a testing-SEIRD model that depends on testing characteristics and limited resources. In this model, people who test positive are admitted to the hospital based on capacity and medical resources. Using this model, we examined the infection spread depending on the ratio of follow-up and mass-testing. The simulations demonstrated that the infection dynamics exhibit an all-or-none response as infection expands or extinguishes. Optimal and worst follow-up and mass-testing combinations were determined depending on the total resources and cost ratio of the two types of testing. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the cumulative deaths varied significantly by hundreds to thousands of times depending on the testing strategy, which is encouraging for policymakers. Therefore, our model might provide guidelines for testing strategies in the cases of recently emerging infectious diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCooperative Study Program of Exploratory Research Centre on Life and Living Systems (ExCELLS) (program Nos.18-201, 19-102, and 19-202 to H.N.), a Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (B) [grant number 21H05170], and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (21H03541 to H.N.) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Exempted from ethical review because no human or animal subjects or specimens are involved.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Multiple factors affecting COVID19 vaccine induced antibody responses in SARS-CoV2 uninfected immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients have been reported; however, there is still a lack of information on non-ACE2 competing cross-CoV2 neutralizing functional antibodies induced in these cohorts, and similarly the vaccine efficacy in prior CoV2-infected immunosuppressed individuals is not well understood.Methods COVID19 vaccine efficacy was compared in a panel of kidney and heart transplant recipients who were either CoV2 uninfected (n=63) or CoV2 infected (n=13) prior to receiving two or three doses of mRNA vaccines using pseudoviral neutralization assays against eight CoV2 strains (the CoV2_D614G ancestral strain, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, kappa, lambda, and omicron-BA1 variants), while plasma antibody titers were determined by ELISA using recombinant CoV2-RBD-wt proteins.Results Minimally protective neutralizing plasma antibody titers (IC50 ≥ 1:50) against the variants were recorded 7-14% and 25-35% after the second and third doses respectively, with Omicron being the most resistant. In contrast, all previously infected vaccinees possessed minimal protective plasma titers against D614G after either two or three vaccine doses, with 11/13 exhibiting strong protection (IC50≥ 1:500) and 10/13 exceeding the minimal protective titer against Omicron. Absorption of the selected plasma with immobilized parental RBD removed ≥ 90% of its neutralizing activity, indicating that the dominant neutralization targets were in the RBD.Conclusions This study showed that CoV2 infection followed by vaccination, but not vaccination alone, induces the presence of potent highly cross-reactive CoV2 neutralizing plasma antibodies that extend to Omicron variants, even in immunosuppressed SOTRs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was partially supported by funding from the center for COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness (CCRP2), Rutgers University.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All study activities were approved by the North Texas Institutional Review Board (1754062-3) and Institutional Biosafety Committee, Rutgers University (20-014)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X INTRODUCTION In Africa almost half of healthcare services are delivered through private sector providers. These are often underused in national public health responses. In line with our previous HIV experience and to support and accelerate the public sector’s COVID-19 response, we initiated a public-private project (PPP) in Kisumu County, Kenya. In this manuscript we demonstrate this PPP’s performance, using COVID-19 testing as an aggregator and with semi-real time digital monitoring tools for rapid scaling of COVID-19 response.METHODS COVID-19 diagnostic testing formed the basis for a PPP between KEMRI, Department of Health Kisumu County, PharmAccess Foundation, and local faith-based and private healthcare facilities: COVID-Dx. COVID-Dx was implemented from June 01, 2020, to March 31, 2021 in Kisumu County, Kenya. Trained laboratory technologists in participating healthcare facilities collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from patients meeting the Kenyan MoH COVID-19 case definition. Samples were rapidly transported by motorbike and tested using RT-PCR at the central reference laboratory in KEMRI. Healthcare workers in participating facilities collected patient clinical data using a digitized MoH COVID-19 Case Identification Form. We shared aggregated results from these data via (semi-) live dashboards with all relevant stakeholders through their mobile phones. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 16 to inform project processes.RESULTS Nine private facilities participated in the project. A detailed patient trajectory was developed from case identification to result reporting, all steps supported by a semi-real time digital dashboard. A total of 4,324 PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 (16%) were added to the public response, identifying 425 positives. Geo-mapped and time-tagged information on incident cases was depicted on Google maps dashboards and fed back to policymakers for informed rapid decision making. Preferential COVID-19 testing was performed on health workers at risk, with 1,009 tested (43% of all County health workforce).CONCLUSION We demonstrate feasibility of rapidly increasing the public health sector response to a COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in an African setting. Our PPP intervention in Kisumu, Kenya was based on a joint testing strategy and demonstrated that semi-real time digitalization of patient trajectories in the healthcare system can gain significant efficiencies, linking public and private healthcare efforts, increasing transparency, support better quality health services and informing policy makers to target interventions. This PPP has since scaled to 33 facilities in Kisumu and subsequently to 84 sites in 14 western Kenyan Counties.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project was financially supported by Achmea Foundation, Pfizer Foundation, and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

%X The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with a dramatic surge of cases around the globe in late 2021 and early 2022. The numerous mutations in this variant, particularly in the Spike protein, enhance its transmission, increase immune evasion, and limit treatment with monoclonal antibodies. Identifying a community’s introduction to a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant with new clinical features related to treatment options and infection control needs is imperative to inform decisions by clinicians and public health officials, and traditional sequencing techniques often take weeks to result. Here, we describe a quantitative reverse transcription PCR assay (RT-qPCR) to accurately and precisely detect the presence of the Omicron sublineages BA.1/BA1.1 and BA.2 viral RNA from patient samples in less than four hours. The assay uses primers targeting the BA.1/BA1.1 unique mutations N211del, L212I, and L214 insertion EPE in the Spike protein gene, and the BA.2 specific mutations T19I and L24/P25/P26 deletion in the Spike protein gene. Using this assay, we detected 169 cases of Omicron, 164 BA.1/BA1.1 and 5 BA.2, from 270 residual SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected for diagnostic purposes from Santa Barbara County (SBC) between December 2021 to February 2022. The RT-qPCR results show concordance with whole viral genome sequencing. Our observations indicate that Omicron was the dominant variant in SB County and is likely responsible for the surge of cases in the area during the sampling period. Using this inexpensive and accurate test, the rapid detection of Omicron in patient samples allowed clinicians to modify treatment strategies and public health officers to enhance contact tracing strategies. This RT-qPCR assay offers an alternative to current variant-specific detection approaches, provides a template for the fast design of similar assays, and allows the rapid, accurate, and inexpensive detection of Omicron variants in patient samples. It can also be readily adapted to new variants as they emerge in the future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the University of California Santa Barbara, the University of California, Office of the President, the CDC's COVID-NET initiative and the Cottage Health Research Institute.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Cottage Health IRB of Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital gave ethical approval for this work in the protocol entitled "Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Santa Barbara County population" (IRB#: 21-04mux)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Japan has reported a small number of COVID-19 cases relative to other countries. Because not all infected people receive diagnostic tests for COVID-19, the reported number of COVID-19 cases must be lower than the actual number of infections. Assessments of the presence of antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can retrospectively determine the history of natural infection and vaccination. In this study, we assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence by analyzing over 60,000 samples collected in Japan from February 2020 to March 2022. The results showed that about 5% of the Japanese population had been infected with the virus by January 2021. The seroprevalence increased with the administration of vaccinations to adults; however, among the elderly, it was not as high as the vaccination rate, probably due to poor immune responses to the vaccines and waning immunity. The infection was spread during the epidemic waves caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants among children who were not eligible for vaccination. Nevertheless, their seroprevalence was as low as 10% as of March 2022. Our study underscores the low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Japan and the effects of vaccination on immunity at the population level.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (JP19fk0108166 and 20fk0108451s0301) and Japan Program for Infectious Diseases Research and Infrastructure (JP22wm0125002) from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo (protocol number 2019-75).

%X This study assessed the impact of various COVID-19 vaccination strategies on health outcomes in Ghana using an age-stratified compartmental model. The population was stratified into three age groups: &lt;25 years, 25-64 years, and 65+ years. Five vaccination optimization scenarios were explored, assuming that one million persons could be vaccinated in three versus six months. We also performed uncertainty analysis by assuming that the available doses were halved and doubled. The vaccine optimization strategies were assessed for the initial strain, followed by a sensitivity analysis for the delta variant by varying the reproduction number and vaccine efficacy. The results showed that vaccinating individuals &lt;65 years was associated with the lowest cumulative infections when one million persons were vaccinated over three months for both the initial strain and the delta variant. On the contrary, prioritizing the elderly (65+) was associated with the lowest cumulative deaths for both strains.One-sentence summary An age-stratified model of COVID-19 vaccination in Ghana found vaccinating individuals &lt;65 years was associated with the lowest cumulative infections when one million persons were vaccinated over three months while prioritizing the elderly (65+) was associated with the lowest cumulative deaths.Competing Interest StatementSylvia Ofori declares that she is a paid intern at Ionis Pharmaceuticals, and the financial relationship does not affect the content of the article.

%X Despite human saliva representing a convenient and non-invasive clinical substrate for disease diagnosis and biomonitoring, its widespread utilization has been hampered by technical challenges. The non-Newtonian, heterogenous and highly viscous nature of clinical saliva samples complicate the development of automated fluid handling processes that are vital for accurate diagnoses. Furthermore, conventional saliva processing methods are either resource and/or time intensive precluding certain testing capabilities in low- and middle-income countries, with these challenges aggravated during a pandemic outbreak. The conventional approaches can also potentially alter analyte structure, reducing application opportunities in Point-of-Care diagnostics. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the SHEAR saliva collection device that preprocesses saliva for enhanced interfacing with downstream assays. We demonstrate the device’s impact on reducing saliva’s viscosity, improving sample uniformity and, increasing diagnostic performance of COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Tests. Importantly, in addition to reporting technical advances and to address downstream implementation factors, we conducted a formal user experience study, which resulted in generally positive comments. Effective implementation of this device could be of support to realize the potential of saliva, particularly in large-scale and/or resource-limited settings for global and community health diagnostics.Competing Interest StatementA.B.

%X BACKGROUND In November 2021, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 “variant of concern” (VOC) B.1.1.529 (“Omicron”) was reported in Germany, alongside global reports of reduced vaccine efficacy against infections with this variant. The potential threat posed by the rapid spread of this variant in Germany remained, at the time, elusive.METHODS We developed a variant-dependent population-averaged susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) infectious disease model. The model was calibrated on the observed fixation dynamics of the Omicron variant in December 2021, and allowed us to estimate potential courses of upcoming infection waves in Germany, focusing on the corresponding burden on intensive care units (ICUs) and the efficacy of contact reduction strategies.RESULTS A maximum median incidence of approximately 300 000 (50% PI in 1000: [181,454], 95% PI in 1000: [55,804]) reported cases per day was expected with the median peak occurring in the mid of February 2022, reaching a cumulative Omicron case count of 16.5 million (50% PI in mio: [11.4, 21.3], 95% PI in mio: [4.1, 27.9]) until Apr 1, 2022. These figures were in line with the actual Omicron waves that were subsequently observed in Germany with respective peaks occurring in mid February (peak: 191k daily new cases) and mid March (peak: 230k daily new cases), cumulatively infecting 14.8 million individuals during the study period. The model peak incidence was observed to be highly sensitive to variations in the assumed generation time and decreased with shorter generation time. Low contact reductions were expected to lead to containment. Early, strict, and short contact reductions could have led to a strong “rebound” effect with high incidences after the end of the respective non-pharmaceutical interventions. Higher vaccine uptake would have led to a lower outbreak size. To ensure that ICU occupancy remained below maximum capacity, a relative risk of requiring ICU care of 10%–20% was necessary (after infection with Omicron vs. infection with Delta).CONCLUSIONS We expected a large cumulative number of infections with the VOC Omicron in Germany with ICU occupancy likely remaining below capacity nevertheless, even without additional non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our estimates were in line with the retrospectively observed waves. The results presented here informed legislation in Germany. The methodology developed in this study might be used to estimate the impact of future waves of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementB.F.M. is supported as an Add-on Fellow for Interdisciplinary Life Science by the Joachim Herz Stiftung.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study used openly available human data that were originally located at https://github.com/robert-koch-institut/SARS-CoV-2_Infektionen_in_Deutschland, https://github.com/robert-koch-institut/SARS-CoV-2-Sequenzdaten_aus_Deutschland, https://github.com/robert-koch-institut/COVID-19-Impfungen_in_Deutschland, https://zenodo.org/record/6470799 or available upon request.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Repeated mRNA vaccinations are an efficient tool to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. High levels of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-antibodies are an important component of vaccine-induced immunity. Shortly after the first or second mRNA vaccine dose, the IgG response mainly consists of the pro-inflammatory isotypes IgG1 and IgG3 and is driven by T helper (Th) 1 cells. Here, we report that several months after the second vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were increasingly composed of non-inflammatory IgG2 and particularly IgG4, which were further boosted by a third mRNA vaccination and/or SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections. While IgG antibodies were affinity matured and of high neutralization capacity, the switch in constant domains caused changes in fragment crystallizable (Fc)-receptor mediated effector functions, including a decreased capacity to facilitate phagocytosis. IgG4 induction was neither induced by Th2 cells nor observed after homologous or heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with adenoviral vectors. In addition, IgG2- and IgG4-producing memory B cells were phenotypically indistinguishable from IgG1- or IgG3-producing cells. Since Fc-mediated effector functions are critical for antiviral immunity, the described class switch towards non-inflammatory IgG isotypes, which otherwise rarely occurs after vaccination or viral infection, may have consequences for the choice and timing of vaccination regimens using mRNA vaccines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was funded by the Bavarian State Ministry for Science and the Arts for the CoVaKo-2021 and For-COVID projects and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF) through the ‘Netzwerk Universitaetsmedizin’, project ‘COVIM’ (to T.H.W. and H.H.).

%X The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants remains a formidable challenge to worldwide public health. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a hotspot for mutations, reflecting its critical role at the ACE2 interface during viral entry. We comprehensively investigated the impact of RBD mutations, including 6 variants of concern (VOC) or interest (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa and Omicron) and 33 common point mutations, on IgG recognition, FcγR-engagement, and ACE2-binding inhibition in plasma from BNT162b2-vaccine recipients (two-weeks following second dose) and mild-to-moderate COVID-19 convalescent subjects using our custom bead-based 39-plex array. We observed that IgG-recognition and FcγR-binding antibodies were most profoundly decreased against Beta and Omicron RBDs, as well as point mutations G446S, found in Omicron, and N501T, a key mutation found in animal adapted SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Measurement of RBD-ACE2 binding affinity via Biolayer Interferometry showed all VOC RBDs have enhanced affinity to human ACE2. Furthermore we demonstrate that human ACE2 polymorphisms, E35K (rs1348114695), K26R (rs4646116) and S19P (rs73635825), have altered binding kinetics to the RBD of VOCs potentially affecting virus-host interaction and thereby host susceptibility.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Victorian Government and Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) GNT2002073 (to A.K.W, P.M.H., W.H.T., D.I.G., S.J.K., and A.W.C.), GNT2005544 (to A.K.W., J.A.J., D.I.G., S.J.K., and A.W.C), the Paul Ramsay Foundation (A.K.W., D.I.G., S.J.K. and A.W.C.).

%X Genetically distinct viral variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recorded since January 2020. Over this time global vaccine programs have been introduced, contributing to lower COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality rates, particularly in developed countries. In late 2021, the Omicron BA.1 variant emerged, with substantially different genetic differences and clinical effects from other variants of concern (VOC). This variant demonstrated higher numbers of polymorphisms in the gene encoding the Spike (S) protein, and it has displaced the previously dominant Delta variant. Shortly after dominating global spread in early 2022, BA.1 was supplanted by the genetically distinct Omicron lineage BA.2. A sub-lineage of BA.2, designated BA.5 has now started to dominate globally, with the potential to supplant BA.2. To address the relative threat of BA.5, we determined infectivity to particle ratios in primary nasopharyngeal samples and expanded low passage isolates in a well characterised, genetically engineered ACE2/TMPRSS2 cell line. We then assessed the impact of BA.5 infection on humoral neutralisation in vitro, in vaccinated and convalescent cohorts, using concentrated human IgG pooled from thousands of plasma donors, and licensed monoclonal antibody therapies. The infectivity of virus in primary swabs and expanded isolates revealed that whilst BA.1 and BA.2 are attenuated through ACE2/TMPRSS2, BA.5 infectivity is equivalent to that of an early 2020 circulating clade and has greater sensitivity to the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Nafamostat. As with BA.1, we observed BA.5 to significantly reduce neutralisation titres across all donors. Concentrated pooled human IgG from convalescent and vaccinated donors had greater breadth of neutralisation, although the potency was still reduced 7-fold with BA.5. Of all therapeutic antibodies tested, we observed a 14.3-fold reduction using Evusheld and 16.8-fold reduction using Sotrovimab when neutralising a Clade A versus BA.5 isolate. These results have implications for ongoing tracking and management of Omicron waves globally.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementMRF2005760/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) MRF2001684/Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Covid Rd 2 Grant/NSW Ministry of Health (NSW Health)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All human serum samples were obtained with written informed consent from the participants (2020/ETH00964; 2020/ETH02068) and are approved through the St Vincents Hospital Sydney NSW Ethics committeeI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The Sinovac SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac) has been demonstrated to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in preventing mild and severe Covid-19. Although different studies have demonstrated its short-term immunogenicity, long-term cellular and humoral response evaluations are still lacking.Methods Cellular and humoral responses were assessed after enrollment of volunteers in the PROFISCOV phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate CoronaVac. Assays were performed using flow cytometry to evaluate cellular immune response and an antigen binding electrochemiluminescence assay to detect antigen-specific antibodies to the virus.Results Fifty-three volunteers were selected for long term assessment of their SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses. CD4+ T cell responses (including circulating follicular helper (cTfh, CD45RA- CXCR5+) expressing CD40L, as well as non-cTfh cells expressing CXCR3) were observed early upon the first vaccine dose, increased after the second dose, remaining stable for 6-months. Memory CD4+ T cells were detected in almost all vaccinees, the majority being central memory T cells. IgG levels against Wuhan/WH04/2020 N, S and receptor binding domain (RBD) antigens and the variants of concern (VOCs, including B.1.1.7/Alpha, B.1.351/Beta and P.1/Gamma) S and RBD antigens peaked 14 days after the second vaccine shot, and were mostly stable for a 1-year period.Conclusions CoronaVac two-doses regimen is able to induce a potent and durable SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular response. The cellular reaction is part of a coordinated immune response that includes high levels of specific IgG levels against parental and SARS-CoV-2 VOC strains, still detected after one year.Funding Fundação Butantan, Instituto Butantan and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) (grants 2020/10127-1 and 2020/06409-1).

%X Wastewater surveillance (WWS) of SARS-CoV-2 was proven to be a reliable and complementary tool for population-wide monitoring of COVID-19 disease incidence but was not as rigorously explored as an indicator for disease burden throughout the pandemic. Prior to global mass immunization campaigns and during the spread of the wildtype COVID-19 and the Alpha variant of concern (VOC), viral measurement of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater was a leading indicator for both COVID-19 incidence and disease burden in communities. As the two-dose vaccination rates escalated during the spread of the Delta VOC in Jul. 2021 through Dec. 2021, relations weakened between wastewater signal and community COVID-19 disease incidence and maintained a strong relationship with clinical metrics indicative of disease burden (new hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths). Further, with the onset of the vaccine-resistant Omicron BA.1 VOC in Dec. 2021 through Mar. 2022, wastewater again became a strong indicator of both disease incidence and burden during a period of limited natural immunization (no recent infection), vaccine escape, and waned vaccine effectiveness. Lastly, with the populations regaining enhanced natural and vaccination immunization shortly prior to the onset of the Omicron BA.2 VOC in mid-Mar 2022, wastewater is shown to be a strong indicator for both disease incidence and burden. Hospitalization-to-wastewater ratio is further shown to be a good indicator of VOC virulence when widespread clinical testing is limited. In the future, WWS is expected to show moderate indication of incidence and strong indication of disease burden in the community during future potential seasonal vaccination campaigns.HighlightsNeed to elucidate interpretation of CoV-2 WWS for seasonal vaccination campaigns.WWS to incidence relation weakens with peak natural and vaccination immunization.WWS to hospitalization remains strong with natural and vaccination immunization.WWS as indicator of hospitalization during future seasonal vaccination campaigns.WWS/hospitalization as indicator of VOC virulence with limited clinical testing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by "The Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks" under the Government of Ontario.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on health systems and economies across the globe. Implementing public health measures in tandem with effective vaccination strategies have been instrumental in curtailing the burden of the pandemic. With the three vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. having varying efficacies and waning effects against major COVID-19 strains, understanding the impact of these vaccines on COVID-19 incidence and fatalities is critical. Here, we formulate and use mathematical models to assess the impact of vaccine type, vaccination and booster uptake, and waning of natural and vaccine-induced immunity on the incidence and fatalities of COVID-19 and to predict future trends of the disease in the U.S. when existing control measures are reinforced or relaxed. Results of the study show a 5, 1.8, and 2 times reduction in the reproduction number during the period in which vaccination, first booster, and second booster uptake started, respectively, compared to the previous period. Due to waning of vaccine-induced immunity, vaccinating up to 96% of the U.S. population might be required to attain herd immunity, if booster uptake is low. Additionally, vaccinating and boosting more people from the onset of vaccination and booster uptake, especially with mRNA vaccines (which confer superior protection than the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) would have led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. Furthermore, adopting natural immunity-boosting measures is important in fighting COVID-19 and transmission rate reduction measures such as mask-use are critical in combating COVID-19. The emergence of a more transmissible COVID-19 variant, or early relaxation of existing control measures can lead to a more devastating wave, especially if transmission rate reduction measures and vaccination are relaxed simultaneously, while chances of containing the pandemic are enhanced if both vaccination and transmission rate reduction measures are reinforced simultaneously. We conclude that maintaining or improving existing control measures and boosting with mRNA vaccines are critical in curtailing the burden of the pandemic in the U.S.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCNN acknowledges the support of the Simons Foundation (Award #627346) and the National Science Foundation (Grant Number: DMS #2151870).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Cancer patients show increased morbidity with COVID-19 and need effective immunization strategies. We demonstrate that a 3rd dose of COVID-19 vaccine leads to seroconversion in 57% of patients that were seronegative after primary vaccination. The immune response is durable as assessed by anti-S antibody titers, T-cell activity and neutralization activity against wild-type SARS-CoV2 and BA1.1.529 at 6 months of follow up. A subset of severely immunocompromised hematologic malignancy patients were unable to mount adequate immune response after the 3rd dose and were treated with a 4th dose in a prospective clinical trial which led to adequate immune-boost in 67% of patients. Low baseline IgM levels and CD19 counts were associated with inadequate seroconversion. Booster doses induced limited neutralization activity against the Omicron variant. These results indicate that vaccine booster-induced immunity is durable in cancer patients and additional doses can further stimulate immunity in a subset of hematologic malignancy patients.Statement of significance We demonstrate that a 3rd dose of vaccine leads to seroconversion in 57% of negative patients with durable immune responses at 6 months. A 4th dose of vaccine can seroconvert hematologic malignancy patients with higher baseline IgM and CD19 levels.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%X Background Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection primes the immune system and thus individuals who recovered from infection have enhanced immune responses to subsequent vaccination (hybrid immunity). However, it remains unclear how well hybrid immunity induced by severe or mild infection can cross-neutralize emerging variants. We aimed to compare the strength and breadth of antibody responses in vaccinated recovered and uninfected subjects.Methods We measured spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from vaccinated subjects including 320 with hybrid immunity and 20 without previous infection. From 29 subjects with a previous severe or mild infection, we also measured NAb responses against Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529/BA.1) variants following vaccination.Results A single vaccine dose induced 2-fold higher anti-spike IgG concentrations and 3-fold higher neutralizing potency of antibodies in previously infected compared to uninfected fully vaccinated subjects. We found similar IgG concentrations in previously infected subjects after one or two vaccine doses. NAb titers were higher in subjects with severe compared to those with mild infection. This difference remained after vaccination with sequentially decreasing titers against Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants.Conclusions Hybrid immunity induced strong IgG responses, particularly after severe infection. However, the NAb titers were low against heterologous variants, especially against Omicron.Competing Interest StatementFinnish Institute for Health and Welfare conducts Public-Private Partnership with vaccine manufacturers and has received research funding for studies unrelated to COVID-19 from GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines (N.E, C.V, A.A.P, and M.M as investigators), Pfizer (A.A.P) and Sanofi Pasteur (A.A.P, T.N).

%X Treatment strategies that target host entry factors have proven an effective means of impeding viral entry in HIV and may be more robust to viral evolution than drugs targeting viral proteins directly. High-throughput functional screens provide an unbiased means of identifying genes that influence the infection of host cells, while retrospective cohort analysis can measure the real-world, clinical potential of repurposing existing therapeutics as antiviral treatments. Here, we combine these two powerful methods to identify drugs that alter the clinical course of COVID-19 by targeting host entry factors. We demonstrate that integrative analysis of genome-wide CRISPR screening datasets enables network-based prioritization of drugs modulating viral entry, and we identify three common medications (spironolactone, quetiapine, and carvedilol) based on their network proximity to putative host factors. To understand the drugs’ real-world impact, we perform a propensity-score-matched, retrospective cohort study of 64,349 COVID-19 patients and show that spironolactone use is associated with improved clinical prognosis, measured by both ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates. Finally, we show that spironolactone exerts a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on viral entry in a human lung epithelial cell line. Our results suggest that spironolactone may improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19 through tissue-dependent inhibition of viral entry. Our work further provides a potential approach to integrate functional genomics with real-world evidence for drug repurposing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [GM007365 to H.C., GM102365 to R.A., LM013337 to Y.L., and HG011316 to L.C.], by the Donald and Delia Baxter Foundation [to L.C.], by the National Science Foundation [1953686 to M.W. and 1953415 to L.C.], and by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarships [to H.C.].

%X The recently derived Hybrid-Incidence Susceptible-TransmissibleRemoved (HI-STR) prototype is a deterministic epidemic compartment model and an alternative to the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model prototype. The HI-STR predicts that pathogen transmission depends on host population characteristics including population size, population density and some common host behavioural characteristics.The HI-STR prototype is applied to the ancestral Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) to show that the original estimates of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) basic reproduction number (ℛ0) for the United Kingdom (UK) could have been projected on the individual states of the United States of America (USA) prior to being detected in the USA.The Imperial College London (ICL) group’s ℛ0 estimate for the UK is projected onto each USA state. The difference between these projections and ICL’s estimates for USA states is either not statistically significant on the paired student t-test or epidemiologically insignificant.Projection provides a baseline for evaluating the real-time impact of an intervention. Sensitivity analysis was conducted because of considerable variance in parameter estimates across studies. Although the HI-STR predicts that in-creasing symptomatic ratio and inherently immune ratio reduce ℛ0, relative to the uncertainty in the estimates of ℛ0 for the ancestral SARS-CoV2, the projection is insensitive to the inherently immune ratio and the symptomatic ratio.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Estimating the differences in the incubation-period, serial-interval, and generation-interval distributions of SARS-CoV-2 variants is critical to understanding their transmission and control. However, the impact of epidemic dynamics is often neglected in estimating the timing of infection and transmission—for example, when an epidemic is growing exponentially, a cohort of infected individuals who developed symptoms at the same time are more likely to have been infected recently. Here, we re-analyze incubation-period and serial-interval data describing transmissions of the Delta and Omicron variants from the Netherlands at the end of December 2021. Previous analysis of the same data set reported shorter mean observed incubation period (3.2 days vs 4.4 days) and serial interval (3.5 days vs 4.1 days) for the Omicron variant, but the number of infections caused by the Delta variant decreased during this period as the number of Omicron infections increased. When we account for growth-rate differences of two variants during the study period, we estimate similar mean incubation periods (3.8–4.5 days) for both variants but a shorter mean generation interval for the Omicron variant (3.0 days; 95% CI: 2.7–3.2 days) than for the Delta variant (3.8 days; 95% CI: 3.7–4.0 days). We further note that the differences in estimated generation intervals may be driven by the “network effect”—higher effective transmissibility of the Omicron variant can cause faster susceptible depletion among contact networks, which in turn prevents late transmission (therefore shortening realized generation intervals). Using up-to-date generation-interval distributions is critical to accurately estimating the reproduction advantage of the Omicron variant.Significance Recent studies suggest that individuals infected with the Omicron variant develop symptoms earlier (shorter incubation period) and transmit faster (shorter generation interval) than those infected with the Delta variant. However, these studies typically neglect population-level effects: when an epidemic is growing, a greater proportion of current cases were infected recently, biasing us toward observing faster transmission events. Accounting for this dynamical bias, we find that Omicron infections from the Netherlands at the end of December 2021 had similar incubation periods, but shorter generation intervals, compared to Delta infections from the same period. Shorter generation intervals of the Omicron variant might be due to its higher effective reproduction number, which can cause faster local susceptible depletion around the contact network.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJD was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the Michael G.

%T Hybrid immunity expands the functional humoral footprint of both mRNA and vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines

%X The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a revolution in vaccine development, leading to the testing and approval of several global vaccine platforms that have shown tremendous promise in curbing the pandemic. Yet, despite these successes, waning immunity, and the emergence of variants of concern linked to rising breakthrough infections among vaccinees, have begun to highlight opportunities to improve vaccine platforms and deployment. Real-world vaccine efficacy has highlighted the reduced risk of breakthrough infection and disease among individuals infected and vaccinated, otherwise referred to as hybrid immunity. Hybrid immunity points to the potential for more vigorous or distinct immunity primed by the infection and may confer enhanced protection from COVID-19. Beyond augmented hybrid induced neutralizing antibody and T cell immune responses, here we sought to define whether hybrid immunity may shape the functional humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 following Pfizer/BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA1273 mRNA-based, and ChadOx1/AZ1222 and Ad26.COV2.S vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Each vaccine exhibited a unique functional humoral immune profile in the setting of naïve or hybrid immunity. However, hybrid immunity showed a unique augmentation in S2-domain specific functional humoral immunity that was poorly induced in the setting of naïve immune response. These data highlight the immunodominant effect of the S1-domain in the setting of natural immunity, which is highly variable during viral evolution, and the importance of natural infection in breaking this immunodominance in driving immunity to the S2 region of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 domain that is more conserved across variants of concern.Competing Interest StatementG.A. is a founder and equity holder for Seromyx Systems Inc., an employee and equity holder for Leyden Labs, and has received financial support from Abbvie, BioNtech, GSK, Gilead, Merck, Moderna, Novartis, Pfizer, and Sanofi.

%X Objectives The humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with chronic inflammatory disease (CID) declines more rapidly with TNFα inhibition. Furthermore, the efficacy of current vaccines against Omicron variants of concern (VOC) including BA.2 is limited. Alterations within immune cell populations, changes in IgG affinity and the ability to neutralise a pre-VOC strain and the BA.2 virus were investigated in these at-risk patients.Methods Serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgG avidity and neutralising antibodies (NA) were determined in anti-TNFα patients (n=10) and controls (n=24 healthy individuals; n=12 patients under other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, oDMARD) before and after the second and third vaccination by ELISA, immunoblot and live virus neutralisation assay. SARS-CoV-2-specific B-and T cell subsets were analysed by multicolour flow cytometry.Results IgG avidity and anti-pre-VOC NA titres decreased faster in anti-TNFα recipients than in controls 6 months after the second vaccination (healthy individuals: avidity: p≤0.0001; NA: p=0.0347; oDMARDs: avidity: p=0.0012; NA: p=0.0293). Total plasma cell counts were increased in anti-TNFα patients (Healthy individuals: p=0.0344; oDMARDs: p=0.0254), whereas absolute numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific cells were comparable 7 days after vaccination. These patients had lower BA.2 NA titres compared to both other groups, even after the third vaccination.Conclusions We show a reduced SARS-CoV-2 neutralising capacity in patients under TNFα blockade. In this cohort, the plasma cell response appears to be less specific and show stronger bystander activation. While these effects were observable after the first two vaccinations and with older VOC, the differences in responses to BA.2 were magnified.What is already known on this topic Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases treated with TNFα inhibitors show a greater decrease in SARS-CoV-2 IgG 6 months after the second vaccination than patients taking oDMARDs and healthy individuals.What this study adds Antibodies from patients taking TNFα blockers have a lower SARS-CoV-2 neutralising capacity and maturity. Plasma cells from these patients exhibit less specific immune reaction. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are less activated. Neutralisation against BA.2 is drastically reduced even after the third vaccination.How this study might affect research, practice or policy This study emphasizes the need to protect vulnerable groups such as patients using TNF inhibitors. They could benefit from Omicron-adapted vaccination, but most likely they need to be protected by additional means other than vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCross-funded by Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (Grant GAIN_01GM1910D), DIO002/CoVispecT research grant from the Land Schleswig-Holstein, the German Network University Medicine NUM NaFoUniMedCovid19 (FKZ: 01KX2021), project COVIM and by the Deutsche Forschungs-Gemeinschaft Cluster of Excellence Precision Medicine in Chronic Inflammation and Transregio 130.

%X The rapid succession of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the need to understand the factors driving pathogen evolution. Here, we investigate a possible tradeoff between the rate of progression of a disease and its reproductive number. Using an SEIR framework, we show that in the exponential growth phase of an epidemic, there is an optimal disease duration that balances the advantage of a fast disease progression with that of causing many secondary infections. This result offers one possible explanation for the ever shorter generation times of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2, as it progressed from the original strain to the Alpha, Delta, and, from late 2021 onwards, to several Omicron variant subtypes. In the endemic state, the optimum disappears and longer disease duration becomes advantageous for the pathogen. However, selection pressures depend on context: mitigation strategies such as quarantine of infected individuals may slow down the evolution towards longer-lasting, more infectious variants. This work then suggests that, in the future, the trend towards shorter generation times may reverse, and SARS-CoV-2 may instead evolve towards longer-lasting variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementKS and AE have received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no. 740704).

%X The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and subsequently spread throughout the world, causing over 529 million cases and 6 million deaths thus far. In this study, we formulate a continuous-time Markov chain model to investigate the influence of superspreading events (SSEs), defined here as public or social events that result in multiple infections over a short time span, on SARS-CoV-2 outbreak dynamics. Using Gillespie’s direct algorithm, we simulate a continuous-time Markov chain model for SARS-CoV-2 spread under multiple scenarios: first, with neither hospitalisation nor quarantine; second, with hospitalisation, quarantine, premature hospital discharge, and quarantine violation; and third, with hospitalisation and quarantine but neither premature hospital discharge nor quarantine violation. We also vary quarantine violation rates. Results indicate that, in most cases, SSE-dominated outbreaks are more variable but less severe than non-SSE-dominated outbreaks, though the most severe SSE-dominated outbreaks are more severe than the most severe non-SSE-dominated outbreaks. SSE-dominated outbreaks are outbreaks with relatively higher SSE rates. In all cases, SSE-dominated outbreaks are more sensitive to control measures, with premature hospital discharge and quarantine violation substantially reducing control measure effectiveness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research is supported by National Science Foundation under the grant number DMS 2028297.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study used openly available data that were originally used in Agusto et al.

%X Background SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading disease affecting human life and the economy on a global scale. The disease has caused so far more then 5.5 million deaths. The omicron outbreak that emerged in Botswana in the south of Africa spread around the globe at further increased rates, and caused unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 infection incidences in several countries. At the start of December 2021 the first omicron cases were reported in France.Methods In this paper we investigate the contagiousness of this novel variant relatively to the delta variant that was also in circulation in France at that time. Using a dynamic multi-variant model accounting for cross-immunity through a status-based approach, we analyze screening data reported by Santé Publique France over 13 metropolitan French regions between 1st of December 2021 and the 30th of January 2022. During the investigated period, the delta variant was replaced by omicron in all metropolitan regions in approximately three weeks. The analysis conducted retrospectively allows us to consider the whole replacement time window and compare regions with different times of omicron introduction and baseline levels of variants’ transmission potential. As large uncertainties regarding cross-immunity among variants persist, uncertainty analyses were carried out to assess its impact on our estimations.Results Assuming that 80% of the population was immunized against delta, a cross delta/omicron cross-immunity of 25% and omicron generation time was 3.5 days, the relative strength of omicron to delta, expressed as the ratio of their respective reproduction rates,, was found to range between 1.51 and 1.86 across regions. Uncertainty analysis on epidemiological parameters led ranging over 1.57-2.13 when averaged over the metropolitan French regions, weighting by population size.Conclusions Upon introduction, omicron spread rapidly through the French territory and showed a high fitness relative to delta. We documented considerable geographical heterogeneities on the spreading dynamics. The historical reconstruction of variant emergence dynamics provide valuable ground knowledge to face future variant emergence events.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101016167, ORCHESTRA (Connecting European Cohorts to Increase Common and Effective Response to SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) have been key drivers of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic waves. To better understand variant epidemiologic characteristics, here we apply a model-inference system to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in South Africa, a country that has experienced three VOC pandemic waves (i.e. Beta, Delta, and Omicron). We estimate key epidemiologic quantities in each of the nine South African provinces during March 2020 – Feb 2022, while accounting for changing detection rates, infection seasonality, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination. Model validation shows that estimated underlying infection rates and key parameters (e.g., infection-detection rate and infection-fatality risk) are in line with independent epidemiological data and investigations. In addition, retrospective predictions capture pandemic trajectories beyond the model training period. These detailed, validated model-inference estimates thus enable quantification of both the immune erosion potential and transmissibility of three major SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, i.e., Beta, Delta, and Omicron. These findings help elucidate changing COVID-19 dynamics and inform future public health planning.Competing Interest StatementJS and Columbia University disclose partial ownership of SK Analytics.

To mitigate hospitalizations and death, local public health relies on clinical surveillance to locate and monitor influenza-like illnesses and/or influenza cases and outbreaks. At an international level, the global integration of clinical surveillance networks is the only reliable method to report influenza types and subtypes and warn of an emergent pandemic strain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demonstrated utility of wastewater surveillance (WWS) in complementing or even replacing clinical surveillance, the latter a resource-intensive enterprise, was predicated on the presence of stable viral fragments in wastewater. We show that influenza virus targets are stable in wastewaters and partitions to the solids fraction. We subsequently quantify, type, and subtype influenza virus in municipal wastewater and primary sludge throughout the course of a community outbreak. This research demonstrates the feasibility of applying influenza virus WWS to city and neighbourhood levels; showing a 17-day lead time in forecasting a citywide flu outbreak and providing population-level viral subtyping in near real-time using minimal resources and infrastructure.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by the Province of Ontario's Wastewater Surveillance Initiative (WSI).

%X Object It remains unelucidated regarding the effects of vaccination on disease severity and factors for viral clearance and hospitalization in omicron-infected patients.Methods The clinical manifestations of 3,265 Omicron-infected patients (BA.2 variant; the Omicron group) were compared with those of 226 Delta-infected patients (the Delta group).A Multi-class logistic regression model was employed to analyze the impacts of vaccination doses and intervals on disease severity; a logistic regression model to evaluate the risk factors for hospitalization; R 4.1.2 data analysis to investigate the factors for time for nucleic acid negativization (NAN).Results Compared with the Delta group, the Omicron group reported a fast transmission, mild symptoms, and lower severity incidence, and a significant inverse correlation of vaccination dose with clinical severity (OR: 0.803, 95%CI: 0.742-0.868, p&lt;0.001). Of the 7 or 5 categories of vaccination status, the risk of severity significantly decreased only at ≥21 days after three doses (OR: 0.618, 95% CI: 0.475-0.803, p&lt;0.001; OR: 0.627, 95% CI: 0.482-0.815, p&lt;0.001, respectively). The Omicron group also reported underlying illness as an independent factor for hospitalization, sore throat as a protective factor, and much shorter time for NAN [15 (12,19) vs. 16 (12,22), p&lt;0.05]. NAN was associated positively with age, female gender, fever, cough, and disease severity, but negatively with vaccination doses.Conclusion Booster vaccination should be advocated for COVID-19 pandemic-related control and prevention policies and adequate precautions should be taken for patients with underlying conditions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the following Fundings;Central Government Guiding Local Science and Technology Development of Fujian Province(2021L3018), Fujian Science and Technology Guidance Project(2021Y0100), The Major Health Research Project of Fujian Province(2021ZD01001), Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2021J01658;2019J01178).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Informed consent was granted by all patients and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Quanzhou City (No. 202212) and of the Affiliated Hospital of Putian University (No. 202152).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Objective To compare ‘hybrid immunity’ (prior COVID-19 infection plus vaccination) and post-vaccination immunity to SARS CoV-2 in MS patients on different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and to assess the impact of vaccine product and race/ethnicity on post-vaccination immune responses.Methods Consecutive MS patients from NYU MS Care Center (New York, NY), aged 18-60, who completed COVID-19 vaccination series ≥6 weeks previously were evaluated for SARS CoV-2-specific antibody responses with electro-chemiluminescence and multiepitope bead-based immunoassays and, in a subset, live virus immunofluorescence-based microneutralization assay. SARS CoV-2-specific cellular responses were assessed with cellular stimulation TruCulture IFNγ and IL-2 assay and, in a subset, with IFNγ and IL-2 ELISpot assays. Multivariate analyses examined associations between immunologic responses and prior COVID-19 infection while controlling for age, sex, DMT at vaccination, time-to-vaccine, and vaccine product.Results Between 6/01/2021-11/11/2021, 370 MS patients were recruited (mean age 40.6 years; 76% female; 53% non-White; 22% with prior infection; common DMT classes: ocrelizumab 40%; natalizumab 15%, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators 13%; and no DMT 8%). Vaccine-to-collection time was 18.7 (±7.7) weeks and 95% of patients received mRNA vaccines. In multivariate analyses, patients with laboratory-confirmed prior COVID-19 infection had significantly increased antibody and cellular post-vaccination responses compared to those without prior infection. Vaccine product and DMT class were independent predictors of antibody and cellular responses, while race/ethnicity was not.Interpretation Prior COVID-19 infection is associated with enhanced antibody and cellular post-vaccine responses independent of DMT class and vaccine type. There were no differences in immune responses across race/ethnic groups.Competing Interest StatementIK served on the scientific advisory board for Biogen Idec, Genentech, Alexion, EMDSerono, Horizon; received consulting fees from Roche; and received research support from Guthy-Jackson Charitable Foundation, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Biogen Idec, Serono, Genzyme, and Genentech/Roche; he receives royalties from Wolters Kluwer for 'Top 100 Diagnosis in Neurology'.

%X Background On-arrival quarantine has been one of the primary measures used to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 into Hong Kong since the start of the pandemic. Most on-arrival quarantines have been done in hotels, with the duration of quarantine and testing frequency during quarantine varying throughout the pandemic for various reasons. However, hotels are not necessarily designed with infection control in mind. We aimed to study the potential risk of transmission between persons in on-arrival quarantine.Methods We examined data on each laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case identified in on-arrival quarantine in a hotel in Hong Kong between 1 May 2020 and 31 January 2022. We sequenced the full genomes of viruses from cases that overlapped with other confirmed cases in terms of the hotel of stay, date of arrival and date of testing positive. A combination of epidemiological information and sequence information was then used to identify probable transmission events.Findings Among 221 imported cases that overlapped with other quarantined cases, phylogenetic analysis identified eight suspected clusters comprising 20 cases in total. Only three of these clusters had been recognised as hotel transmission events.Interpretation We have identified potential occurrences of COVID-19 transmission within hotel quarantine in Hong Kong demonstrating the underlying low but non-zero risk associated with sequestering arrivals within hotels. In future pandemics, on-arrival quarantine in hotels could be used to delay the introduction of infection, but the construction of purpose-built facilities for on-arrival quarantine might be necessary to minimize importation risk.Funding Health and Medical Research Fund, Hong KongCompeting Interest StatementBJC consults for AstraZeneca, Fosun Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Moderna, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi Pasteur.

%X Background We estimated the protection against the Omicron BA.2 variant associated with prior primary infection (PI) due to pre-Omicron or Omicron BA.1 virus, with and without mRNA vaccination.Methods A test-negative case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs) tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, Canada, between March 27 and June 4, 2022, when BA.2 predominated and was presumptively diagnosed. Logistic regression models compared the likelihood of BA.2 reinfection (second positive test ≥30 days after PI) among HCWs with history of PI and none to three doses of mRNA vaccine versus infection-naïve, unvaccinated HCWs.Findings Among 37,732 presumed BA.2 cases, 2,521 (6.7%) and 659 (1.7%) were reinfections following pre-Omicron or BA.1 PI, respectively. Among 73,507 controls, 7,360 (10.0%) and 12,315 (16.8%) had a pre-Omicron or BA.1 PI, respectively. Pre-Omicron PI was associated with 38% (95%CI:19-53) reduction in BA.2 infection risk, with higher BA.2 protection among those also vaccinated with one (56%), two (69%) or three (70%) vaccine doses. Omicron BA.1 PI was associated with greater protection against BA.2 (72%; 95%CI:65-78), higher among two-dose vaccinated at 96% (95%CI:95-96) but not improved with a third dose (96%; 95%CI:95-97). Hybrid Omicron BA.1 PI plus two or three dose vaccine-induced protection persisted for five months post-infection.Interpretation Twice-vaccinated individuals who experienced BA.1 infection were subsequently well-protected for a prolonged period against BA.2 reinfection and derived no meaningful added benefit against BA.2 from a third dose of mRNA vaccine.Competing Interest StatementSC, MO and GDS reports that the Ministère de la santé et des services sociaux du Québec gave financial support to their institution for this work during the conduct of the study.

%X Background Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) have a diminished response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in comparison to immunocompetent individuals. Deeper understanding of the antibody response in KTRs following third-dose vaccination would enable identification of those who remain unprotected against Omicron and require additional treatment strategies.Methods We profiled antibody responses in KTRs pre- and at one and three months post-third-dose SARS-CoV2 mRNA-based vaccine. Anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG levels were determined by ELISA. Neutralization against wild-type, Beta, Delta and Omicron (BA.1) variants was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus assay.Results 44 KTRs were analysed at 1 and 3 months (n=26) post-third-dose. At one month, the proportion of participants with a robust antibody response had increased significantly from baseline, but Omicron-specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in just 45% of KTRs. Median binding antibody levels declined at 3 months, but the proportion of KTRs with a robust antibody response was unchanged. 38.5% KTRs maintained Omicron-specific neutralization at 3 months. No clinical variables were significantly associated with detectable Omicron neutralizing antibodies, but anti-RBD titres appeared to identify those with Omicron-specific neutralizing capacity.Conclusion Over 50% of KTRs lack an Omicron-specific neutralization response 1 month following a third mRNA-vaccine dose. Among responders, binding and neutralizing antibody responses were well preserved at 3 months. Anti-RBD antibody titres may be a useful identifier of patients with detectable Omicron neutralizing antibody response.Trial registration Clinical Trials Ontario: ID 3604Funding Funded by the St. Michael’s Hospital Foundation (CMM, DAY) and the Public Health Agency of Canada, through the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (MAH, MJO, AL).Competing Interest StatementAll authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf.

%X Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in immunocompromised patients may lead to accelerated viral mutation rate, immune evasion and persistent viral shedding over many months. Here we report the case of a severely immunocompromised cancer patient infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 for over 8 months. Genome sequencing of samples taken after repeated monoclonal antibody treatments reveal the emergence and accumulation of mutations enabling escape from neutralization by antibodies. Mutations emerging in accessory and non-structural viral proteins target specific residues of immunomodulatory domains, potentially leading to loss of some functions, while preserving others. The mutated virus managed to completely overcome neutralization by monoclonal antibodies while remaining viable and infective. Our results suggest that the loss of specific immunomodulatory viral functions might confer a selective advantage in immunocompromised hosts. We also compare between mutations emerging in the presence and absence of neutralizing antibodies.HighlightsSARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid evolution in an immunocompromised, chronically infected cancer patient, overcoming neutralization by two monoclonal antibody cocktail treatmentsReceptor binding domain (RBD) mutations emerging after monoclonal antibody treatment enable effective escape from neutralization in the absence of adaptive immunitySome emerging mutations are predicted to disrupt immunomodulatory viral proteins, including prevention of ORF8 homodimerization, mis-localization of ORF3a in host cells and alteration of the host-suppressive function of NSP1Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the following grants: Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme, PSY_PGx; The Edmond J.

%X Importance Evidence suggests that early, robust type 1 interferon responses to SARS-CoV-2 are critical determinants for COVID-19 disease outcomes, accelerating viral clearance and limiting viral shedding.Objective We undertook a ring prophylaxis study to determine whether pegylated IFNβ-1α could reduce SARS-CoV-2 household transmission.Design A cluster randomized clinical trial of pegylated IFNβ-1α conducted in Santiago, Chile. Recruitment was conducted between December 4th 2020, and 31st May 2021, with the last follow-up completed June 29th 2021.Setting The study was conducted across 341 households in the metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile.Participants Index cases were identified from databases of those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 clinics and emergency room visits in Santiago, Chile. 5,154 index cases were assessed for eligibility, 1,372 index cases were invited to participate, and 341 index cases and their household contacts (n = 831) were enrolled in the study.Intervention Households were cluster randomized to receive 125µg subcutaneous pegylated IFNβ-1α (n = 172 households, 607 participants), or standard care (n = 169 households, 565 participants).Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) Frequentist and Bayesian analyses were undertaken to determine the effects of treatment on (i) reducing viral shedding in index cases and (ii) reducing viral transmission to treatment-eligible household contacts. Four secondary outcomes were assessed including duration of viral shedding, effects on viral transmission and seroconversion, incidence of hospitalization, and incidence and severity of reported adverse events. A post-hoc ‘at risk population’ was defined as households where the index case was positive at the start of the study and there was at least one treatment eligible contact in a household who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.Results In total, 1172 participants in 341 households underwent randomization, with 607 assigned to receive IFNβ-1α and 565 to standard care. Based on intention to treat and per protocol analyses, IFNβ-1α treatment was ineffective. However, in the ‘at risk’ population, the relative risk of infection was reduced by 23% in treated individuals and that there was a 95% probability that IFNβ-1α reduced household transmissionConclusions and Relevance Ring prophylaxis with IFNβ-1α reduces the probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a household.Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04552379Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04552379Clinical Protocols https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34388972/ Funding StatementThis study was funded by: BHP Holdings Pty Ltd BiogenAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

%X Background Longitudinal data are lacking to compare booster effects of Delta breakthrough infection versus the third vaccine dose on neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against Omicron.Methods Participants were the staff of a national research and medical institution in Tokyo who attended serological surveys on June 2021 (baseline) and December 2021 (follow-up); in between, the Delta-dominant epidemic occurred. Of 844 participants who were infection-naïve and had received two doses of BNT162b2 at baseline, we identified 11 breakthrough infections during the follow-up. One control matched to each case was randomly selected from those who completed the booster vaccine and those who were unboosted by the follow-up. We used the generalized estimating equation model to compare live-virus NAb against Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron across groups.Results Persons who experienced breakthrough infection showed marked increases in NAb titers against Wuhan (4.1-fold) and Delta (5.5-fold), and 64% had detectable NAb against Omicron at follow-up, although the NAb against Omicron after breakthrough infection was 6.7- and 5.2-fold lower than that against Wuhan and Delta, respectively. The increase was apparent only in symptomatic cases and as high as in the third vaccine recipients. In contrast, these titers largely decreased (Wuhan, Delta) or remained undetected (Omicron) at follow-up in infection-naïve and unboosted persons.Conclusions Symptomatic breakthrough infection during the Delta predominant wave was associated with significant increases in NAb against Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron, similar to the third BNT162b2 vaccine. Given the much lower cross-NAb against Omicron than other virus types, however, infection prevention measures must be continued irrespective of vaccine and infection history while the immune evasive variants are circulating.Key points Symptomatic, not asymptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection after the second BNT162b2 vaccination during the Delta-predominant wave enhanced neutralizing antibodies against Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron comparable to the three vaccine doses, although immunity against Omicron was much lower than Wuhan and Delta.Competing Interest StatementAbbott Japan and Roche Diagnostics provided reagents for anti-spike antibody assays.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the NCGM COVID-19 Gift Fund (grant number 19K059) and the Japan Health Research Promotion Bureau Research Fund (grant number 2020-B-09).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study procedure was approved by the ethics committee of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Japan.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Hemodialysis patients are exposed to a markedly increased risk when infected with SARS-CoV-2. To date it is unclear if hemodialysis patients benefit from a fourth vaccination.Methods A total of 142 hemodialysis patients (median age 72.6 years, 33.8% female) received four COVID-19 vaccinations between December 2020 and March 2022. RDB binding antibody titers were determined in a competitive surrogate neutralization assay. Vero-E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529, sub lineage BA.1) in a biosafety level 3 laboratory to determine serum infection neutralization capacity before and after vaccination.Results After the fourth vaccination serum infection neutralization capacity significantly increased from a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50, serum dilution factor 1:x) of 247.0 (46.3-1560.8) to 2560.0 (1174.0-2560.0) for the Delta VoC, and from 37.5 (20.0-198.8) to 668.5 (182.2-2560.0) for the Omicron VoC (each p&lt;0.001). A significant increase of the neutralization capacity was even observed for patients who had high antibody titers after three vaccinations (p&lt;0.001). Univariate regression analysis indicated immunosuppressive medication (p=0.001) and hepatitis B vaccination non-response (p=0.046), and multivariate analysis immunosuppressive medication as the only factor associated with a reduced effect against Delta (p&lt;0.001). Ten patients with SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection before the fourth vaccination had by trend lower prior neutralization capacity for Omicron (p=0.051).Conclusions Our findings suggest that hemodialysis patients benefit from a fourth vaccination in particular in the light of the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. A routinely applied four-time vaccination seems to broaden immunity against variants and would be recommended in hemodialysis patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study, conforming to the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration, was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Klinikum rechts der Isar of the Technical University of Munich (approval number 163/21 S-SR, March 19th, 2021) and registered at the Paul Ehrlich Institute (NIS592).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X SARS-CoV-2 variants raise concern because of their high transmissibility and their ability to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by prior infection or by vaccination. Here we compared the ability of sera from 70 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients infected before the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) and from 16 vaccine breakthrough infection (BTI) cases infected with Gamma or Delta to neutralize the ancestral B.1 strain, and the Gamma, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants using live virus. We further determined antibody levels against the Spike protein, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Spike. Convalescent sera featured considerable variability in neutralization of B.1 and in cross-neutralization of different strains, and neutralizing capacity moderately correlated with antibody levels against Spike and the RBD. All but one convalescent serum failed to neutralize Omicron BA.1. Overall, convalescent sera from patients with moderate disease had higher antibody levels and displayed higher neutralizing ability against all strains than patients with mild or severe forms of disease. Sera from BTI cases fell into one of two categories: half the sera had high neutralizing activity against the ancestral B.1 strain as well as against the infecting strain, while the other half had no or very low neutralizing activity against all strains. Although antibody levels against Spike and the RBD were lower in BTI cases than in unvaccinated convalescent sera, most neutralizing sera also retained partial neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1, indicative of cross-neutralization between B.1, Delta and Omicron and suggestive of higher affinity, as confirmed by the IC50:Ab level ratios. Neutralizing activity of BTI sera was strongly correlated with antibodies against Spike and the RBD. Together, these findings highlight qualitative differences in antibody responses elicited by infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. They further suggest that breakthrough infection with a pre-Omicron variant boosts immunity and induces cross neutralizing antibodies against different strains, including Omicron BA.1.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Fonds National de la Recherche du Luxembourg (FNR COVID-19 FT-1 (14718697 NEUTRACOV), by the Rotary Clubs Luxembourg, and by Ministere de l Education et de la Recherche du Luxembourg.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH) Institutional Review Board.

%X Global observations have shown that the success or failure in preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 largely relies on human behaviours. Human behaviours in preventing and controlling the spread of the disease principally, is dependent on the level of knowledge of the disease, the attitudes adopted by persons due to the level of knowledge of the disease and the decision to adhere to the preventive practices (KAP) of the disease. Since the beginning of this pandemic, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the KAP on the novel COVID-19 among diverse demographic groups. However, no reported studies have been found on the KAP of the COVID-19 pandemic among the deaf in various populations around the world. This study sought to assess the KAP of COVID-19 among deaf persons in the Greater Accra region of Ghana.The design of this study utilized the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey. Good attitude and adherence to the preventive practices of COVID-19 was observed among the deaf persons. However, knowledge about the science of the disease was lacking. Educational campaigns about COVID-19 should also emphasize the teaching and understanding of the science of the virus and the disease to its audience.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval to conduct this study was given by the Ghana Health Service (GHS) Institutional Review Board (IRB) after the study protocol was reviewed.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections ascertained through healthcare and community testing is generally unknown and expected to vary depending on natural factors and changes in test-seeking behaviour. Here we use population surveillance data and reported daily case numbers in the United Kingdom to estimate the rate of case ascertainment. We mathematically describe the relationship between the ascertainment rate, the daily number of reported cases, population prevalence, and the sensitivity of PCR and Lateral Flow tests as a function time since exposure. Applying this model to the data, we estimate that 20-40% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK were ascertained with a positive test with results varying by time and region. Cases of the Alpha variant were ascertained at a higher rate than the wild type variants circulating in the early pandemic, and higher again for the Delta variant and Omi-cron BA.1 sub-lineage, but lower for the BA.2 sub-lineage. Case ascertainment was higher in adults than in children. We further estimate the daily number of infections and compare this to mortality data to estimate that the infection fatality rate increased by a factor of 3 during the period dominated by the Alpha variant, and declined in line with the distribution of vaccines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was received to support this workAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval was not required for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Short-term forecasts of infectious disease burden can contribute to situational awareness and aid capacity planning. Based on best practice in other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are combined into an ensemble. Here we report on the performance of ensembles in predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe between 08 March 2021 and 07 March 2022.Methods We used open-source tools to develop a public European COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths reported from a standardised source over the next one to four weeks. Teams submitted forecasts from March 2021 using standardised quantiles of the predictive distribution. Each week we created an ensemble forecast, where each predictive quantile was calculated as the equally-weighted average (initially the mean and then from 26th July the median) of all individual models’ predictive quantiles. We measured the performance of each model using the relative Weighted Interval Score (WIS), comparing models’ forecast accuracy relative to all other models. We retrospectively explored alternative methods for ensemble forecasts, including weighted averages based on models’ past predictive performance.Results Over 52 weeks we collected and combined up to 28 forecast models for 32 countries. We found a weekly ensemble had a consistently strong performance across countries over time. Across all horizons and locations, the ensemble performed better on relative WIS than 84% of participating models’ forecasts of incident cases (with a total N=862), and 92% of participating models’ forecasts of deaths (N=746). Across a one to four week time horizon, ensemble performance declined with longer forecast periods when forecasting cases, but remained stable over four weeks for incident death forecasts. In every forecast across 32 countries, the ensemble outperformed most contributing models when forecasting either cases or deaths, frequently outperforming all of its individual component models. Among several choices of ensemble methods we found that the most influential and best choice was to use a median average of models instead of using the mean, regardless of methods of weighting component forecast models.Conclusions Our results support the use of combining forecasts from individual models into an ensemble in order to improve predictive performance across epidemiological targets and populations during infectious disease epidemics. Our findings further suggest that median ensemble methods yield better predictive performance more than ones based on means. Our findings also highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death forecasts than incident case forecasts at forecast horizons greater than two weeks.Code and data availability All data and code are publicly available on Github: covid19-forecast-hub-europe/euro-hub-ensemble.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAA, BH, BL, LWa, MMa, PP, SV funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant 1R01GM109718, NSF BIG DATA Grant IIS-1633028, NSF Grant No.: OAC-1916805, NSF Expeditions in Computing Grant CCF-1918656, CCF-1917819, NSF RAPID CNS-2028004, NSF RAPID OAC-2027541, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 75D30119C05935, a grant from Google, University of Virginia Strategic Investment Fund award number SIF160, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under Contract No. HDTRA1-19-D-0007, and respectively Virginia Dept of Health Grant VDH-21-501-0141, VDH-21-501-0143, VDH-21-501-0147, VDH-21-501-0145, VDH-21-501-0146, VDH-21-501-0142, VDH-21-501-0148.

%X Background Rapid antigen tests have been used to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there have been concerns about their decreased sensitivity to the Omicron variant.Aims In this study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests among the players and staff members of the Japan Professional Football League and clubs. Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between the sensitivity and the duration from the onset of the symptoms to testing, the manufacturer of the rapid antigen test kits, and the PCR test analyte.Design and methods This was a retrospective observational study. We used 656 results from both the rapid antigen and PCR tests for COVID-19 using the analytes collected on the same day from January 12 to March 2, 2022, during the Omicron variant outbreak in Japan.Results The sensitivity of the rapid antigen test compared with the PCR test was 0.63 (95% confidence interval: 0.54–0.72) and the specificity was 0.998 (95% confidence interval: 0.995–1.000). There were no significant associations between the sensitivity and the duration from the onset of the symptoms to testing (including asymptomatic cases in the category), vaccination status, manufacturer of the rapid antigen test kit or PCR analyte (P &gt; 0.05) with small effect sizes (Cramer’s V or φ: ≤ 0.22).Conclusions Even during the Omicron outbreak, the sensitivity of the rapid antigen tests did not depend on the duration from the onset of the symptoms to testing.Competing Interest StatementH.S. and T.

%X Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases has diversified due to complex combinations of exposure to vaccination and infection. Elucidating the drivers for upgrading neutralizing activity to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases with pre-existing immunity will aid in understanding immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and improving COVID-19 booster vaccines with enhanced cross-protection against antigenically distinct variants. This study revealed that the magnitude and breadth of neutralization responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in breakthrough infections are determined by upper respiratory viral load and vaccination-infection time interval, but not by the lineage of infecting viruses. Notably, the time interval, but not the viral load, may play a critical role in expanding the breadth of neutralization to SARS-CoV-2. This illustrates the importance of dosing interval optimization in addition to antigen design in the development of variant-proof booster vaccines.One-Sentence Summary Viral load and infection timing define the magnitude and breadth of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization after breakthrough infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (JSPS KAKENHI) grant 21K20768 (SMiyamoto), and Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) grant JP21fk0108104 (TS), JP22fk0108637 (TS), JP20fk0108534 (YT), JP21fk0108615 (YT).

%X Background We evaluate the diagnostic performance of dried blood microsampling combined with a high-throughput microfluidic nano-immunoassay (NIA) for the identification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG seropositivity.Methods We conducted a serological study among 192 individuals with documented prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and 44 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. Participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had a long interval of 11 months since their qRT-PCR positive test. Serum was obtained after venipuncture and tested with an automated electrochemiluminescence anti-SARS-CoV-2 S total Ig reference assay, a commercial ELISA anti-S1 IgG assay, and the index test NIA. 109 participants from the positive cohort and 44 participants from the negative cohort also participated in capillary blood collection using three microsampling devices: Mitra, repurposed glucose test strips, and HemaXis. Samples were dried, shipped by regular mail, extracted, and measured with NIA.Findings Using serum samples, we achieve a clinical sensitivity of 98·33% and specificity of 97·62% on NIA, affirming the high performance of NIA in participants 11 months post infection. Combining microsampling with NIA, we obtain a clinical sensitivity of 95·05% using Mitra, 61·11% using glucose test strips, 83·16% using HemaXis, and 91·49% for HemaXis after automated extraction, without any drop in specificity.Interpretation High sensitivity and specificity was demonstrated when testing micro-volume capillary dried blood samples using NIA, which is expected to facilitate its use in large-scale studies using home-based sampling or samples collected in the field.Funding Swiss National Science Foundation NRP 78 Covid-19 grant 198412 and Private Foundation of the Geneva University Hospital.Evidence before this study Serological surveillance is of importance to better understand the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2 and adapt public health measures. We identified multiple studies conducting such serological surveys using decentralized collection of capillary blood, facilitating the logistics and reducing burden on participants and healthcare facilities. To perform the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with a high-throughput and at low-cost, a microfluidic nano-immunoassay (NIA) was developed which requires ultra-low sample volumes and minimizes reagent consumption.Added value of this study In this study we showed the possibility of combining capillary microsampling with NIA. We validated the use of NIA in serum samples obtained 11 months after infection and show the good clinical performance of the assay in samples with waning antibody titers. Using three different microsampling device, namely Mitra, repurposed glucose test strips, and HemaXis, we implemented a protocol using dried blood sample collection, shipping, extraction, and testing on the microfluidic assay. The sensitivity and specificity were measured and are presented when using the different microsampling devices.Implications of all the available evidence We show that the performance of NIA is good when using serum samples, but also in combination with microsampling. Facilitated logistics and increased convenience of microsampling, together with high-throughput and low-cost testing on a microfluidic assay should facilitate the conduction of serological surveys.Competing Interest StatementThe automated DBS extraction was performed using an instrument loaned free of charge by Gerstel AG.

%X Viral genomic surveillance has been integral in the global response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Surveillance efforts rely on the availability of representative clinical specimens from ongoing testing activities. However, testing practices have recently shifted due to the widespread availability and use of rapid antigen tests, which could lead to gaps in future monitoring efforts. As such, genomic surveillance strategies must adapt to include laboratory workflows that are robust to sample type. To that end, we compare the results of RT-qPCR and viral genome sequencing using samples from positive BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Antigen Card swabs (N=555) to those obtained from previously collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs used for nucleic acid amplification testing (N=135). We show that swabs obtained from antigen cards are comparable in performance to clinical excess samples from NP swabs, providing a viable alternative. This validation permits the reliable expansion of viral genomic surveillance to cases identified in the clinic or home setting where rapid antigen tests are used.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded in part by a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to the University of Florida and the University of Central Florida in order to accelerate regional genomic surveillance.

%X Obesity is associated with an increased risk of severe Covid-19. However, the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in people with obesity is unknown. Here we studied the relationship between body mass index (BMI), hospitalization and mortality due to Covid-19 amongst 3.5 million people in Scotland. Vaccinated people with severe obesity (BMI&gt;40 kg/m2) were significantly more likely to experience hospitalization or death from Covid-19. Excess risk increased with time since vaccination. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study of the immune response in a clinical cohort of vaccinated people with severe obesity. Compared with normal weight people, six months after their second vaccine dose, significantly more people with severe obesity had unquantifiable titres of neutralizing antibody against authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, reduced frequencies of antigen-experienced SARS-CoV-2 Spike-binding B cells, and a dissociation between anti-Spike antibody levels and neutralizing capacity. Neutralizing capacity was restored by a third dose of vaccine, but again declined more rapidly in people with severe obesity. We demonstrate that waning of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced humoral immunity is accelerated in people with severe obesity and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from breakthrough infections. Given the prevalence of obesity, our findings have significant implications for global public health.Competing Interest StatementAS is a member of the Scottish Governments Standing Committee on Pandemic Preparedness and the Risk Stratification Subgroup of the UK Governments New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG).

%X Objectives Recent studies show that Test Positivity Rate (TPR) gain a better correlation than incidence with the number of hospitalized patients in COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, epidemiologist remain sceptical concerning the widespread use of this metric for surveillance, and indicators based on known cases like incidence are still preferred despite the large number of asymptomatic carriers which remain unknown. Our aim is to compare TPR and incidence, to determine which of the two has the best characteristics to predict the trend of hospitalized patients in COVID-19 pandemic.Methods We perform a retrospective study considering 60 cases, using global and local data from Italy in different waves of the pandemic, in order to detect peaks in TPR time series, and peaks in incidence, finding which of the two has the best ability to anticipate peaks in patients admitted in hospitals.Results On average the best TPR based approach anticipates incidence of about 4.6 days (95% CI 2.8, 6.4), more precisely the average distance between TPR peaks and hospitalized peaks is 17.6 days (95% CI 15.0, 20.4) with respect to 13.0 days (95% CI 10.4, 15.8) obtained for incidence. Moreover, the average difference between TPR and incidence increases to more than 6 days in the Delta outbreak during Summer 2021, where presumably the percentage of asymptomatic carriers was larger.Conclusions We conclude that TPR should be used as primary indicator to enable early intervention and for planning hospitals admissions in infectious diseases with asymptomatic carriers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The management of Covid-19 outbreaks presented particular challenges in the prison setting. In this study we describe the results from the implementation of a serial mass testing approach in two adult prisons in northern England. The overall aim was to examine the epidemiology of Covid-19 outbreaks in prisons and help inform public health policy and practice during the pandemic.Methods Repeat mass testing was offered to all eligible staff and residents in a women’s (nresidents=239; nstaff=246) and a men’s (nresidents=703; nstaff=340) prison in February and March 2021 at days 0, 7 and 28 after Covid-19 outbreaks were declared. Positive swab samples were sent for viral whole genome sequencing by COG-UK.Findings Participation in at least one testing round ranged from a low of 67% of staff in the men’s prison to a high of 98% of residents in the women’s prison. The largest outbreak, in the men’s prison (261 cases in residents and 37 cases in staff), continued to see new cases identified at the last testing round on day 28. Test positivity in residents of both prisons was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) at day 28 than on preceding test days, but no significant difference was observed for staff (p&gt;0.05). Epidemiological data in conjunction with sequencing information provided evidence for multiple introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the local community into the prisons, with transmission identified both within wings and between wings among residents and staff. Two distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages were identified in the women’s and men’s prisons, B.1.177 and B.1.17, respectively.Conclusions During a Covid-19 outbreak, timely implementation of a whole prison testing regime can serve to inform a targeted approach to infection prevention and control by identifying the true extent of disease transmission in all (including asymptomatic) individuals. Staff, in particular, should be tested regularly and testing uptake should be as high as possible to minimise the risk of infection incursion. Ensuring high testing uptake across all testing rounds remains a challenge.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNMcG is a recipient of a National Institute for Health Research Professorship award (RP-2017-08-ST2-008).

%X Objective To determine the immediate need for a fourth COVID-19 vaccination based on the neutralizing capacity in patients on methotrexate (MTX) therapy after mRNA booster immunization.Methods In this observational cohort study, neutralizing serum activity against SARS-CoV-2 wildtype (Wu01) and variant of concern (VOC) Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were assessed by pseudovirus neutralization assay before, 4 and 12 weeks after mRNA booster immunization in 50 rheumatic patients on MTX, 26 of whom paused the medication. 44 non-immunosuppressed persons (NIP) served as control group.Results While the neutralizing serum activity against SARS-CoV-2 Wu01 and Omicron variants increased 67-to 73-fold in the NIP after booster vaccination, the serum activity in patients receiving MTX increased only 20-to 23-fold. As a result, significantly lower neutralizing capacities were measured in patients on MTX compared to the NIP at week 4. Patients who continued MTX treatment during vaccination had significantly lower neutralizing serum titres against all three virus strains at week 4 and 12 compared to patients who paused MTX and the control group, except for BA.2 at week 12. Patients who paused MTX reached comparably high neutralization titres as the NIP, except for Wu01 at week 12. Neutralization of omicron variants was significantly lower in comparison to wildtype in both groups.Conclusion Patients pausing MTX showed a similar vaccine response to NIP. Patients who continued MTX demonstrated an impaired booster response indicating a potential benefit of a second booster vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by unconditional donations from Medac, Galapagos and Freunde und Foerderer der Berliner Charite e.V.

%X Importance COVID-19 vaccination is recommended during pregnancy for the protection of the mother. Little is known about the immune response to booster vaccinations during pregnancy.Objective To measure immune responses to COVID-19 primary and booster mRNA vaccination during pregnancy and transplacental antibody transfer to the newborn.Design Prospective cohort study of pregnant participants enrolled from July 2021 to January 2022, with follow up through and up to 12 months after delivery.Setting Multicenter study conducted at 9 academic sites.Participants Pregnant participants who received COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and their newborns.Exposure(s) Primary or booster COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers after primary or booster COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy and antibody transfer to the newborn. Immune responses were compared between primary and booster vaccine recipients in maternal sera at delivery and in cord blood, after adjusting for days since last vaccination.Results In this interim analysis, 167 participants received a primary 2-dose series and 73 received a booster dose of mRNA vaccine during pregnancy. Booster vaccination resulted in significantly higher binding and nAb titers, including to the Omicron BA.1 variant, in maternal serum at delivery and cord blood compared to a primary 2-dose series (range 0.55 to 0.88 log10 higher, p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons). Although levels were significantly lower than to the prototypical D614G variant, nAb to Omicron were present at delivery in 9% (GMT ID50 12.7) of Pfizer and 22% (GMT ID50 14.7) of Moderna recipients, and in 73% (GMT ID50 60.2) of boosted participants (p&lt;0.0001). Transplacental antibody transfer was efficient regardless of vaccination regimen (median transfer ratio range: 1.55-1.77 for binding IgG and 1.00-1.78 for nAb).Conclusions and Relevance COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy elicited robust immune responses in mothers and efficient transplacental antibody transfer to the newborn. A booster dose during pregnancy significantly increased maternal and cord blood antibody levels, including against Omicron.Findings support continued use of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy, including booster doses.Trial Registration clinical trials.gov; Registration Number: NCT05031468; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05031468Question What is the immune response after COVID-19 booster vaccination during pregnancy and how does receipt of a booster dose impact transplacental antibody transfer to the newborn?Findings Receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during pregnancy elicited robust binding and neutralizing antibody responses in the mother and in the newborn. Booster vaccination during pregnancy elicited significantly higher antibody levels in mothers at delivery and cord blood than 2-dose vaccination, including against the Omicron BA.1 variant.Meaning COVID-19 vaccines, especially booster doses, should continue to be strongly recommended during pregnancy.Competing Interest StatementF.M.M. is an investigator of pediatric studies of COVID-19 vaccines for Pfizer and for a pediatric remdesivir study conducted by Gilead Sciences Inc F.M.M. serves as investigator on projects supported by an NIH contract for a Vaccine Treatment and Evaluation Unit (VTEU) F.M.M. serves as member of the Data Safety monitoring Board (DSMB) for clinical trials conducted by Pfizer Moderna Meissa Vaccines Virometix and the NIH F.M.M. is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee of Infectious Diseases (COID) and the Immunization Expert Group of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and Co-Chair of the COVAX Maternal Immunization Working Group.

%X Accurate predictive modeling of pandemics is essential for optimally distributing resources and setting policy. Dozens of case predictions models have been proposed but their accuracy over time and by model type remains unclear. In this study, we analyze all US CDC COVID-19 forecasting models, by first categorizing them and then calculating their mean absolute percent error, both wave-wise and on the complete timeline. We compare their estimates to government-reported case numbers, one another, as well as two baseline models wherein case counts remain static or follow a simple linear trend. The comparison reveals that more than one-third of models fail to outperform a simple static case baseline and two-thirds fail to outperform a simple linear trend forecast. A wave-by-wave comparison of models revealed that no overall modeling approach was superior to others, including ensemble models, and error in modeling has increased over time during the pandemic. This study raises concerns about hosting these models on official public platforms of health organizations including the US-CDC which risks giving them an official imprimatur and further raising concerns if utilized to formulate policy. By offering a universal evaluation method for pandemic forecasting models, we expect this work to serve as the starting point towards the development of more accurate models.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has increased infectivity and immune escape compared with previous variants, and caused massive COVID-19 waves globally. Despite a vast majority (∼90%) of the population of Santa Fe city, Argentina, had been vaccinated and/or had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 by the arrival of Omicron, the epidemic wave that followed was by far the largest one experienced in the city. A serosurvey conducted prior to the arrival of Omicron allowed to assess the acquired humoural defences preceding the wave and to evaluate associations with infection risk and severity during the wave. A very large proportion of the 1455 sampled individuals had immunological memory against COVID-19 at the arrival of Omicron (almost 90%), and about half (48.9%) had high anti-Spike IgG levels (&gt;200 UI/ml). The antibody titres were strongly associated with the number of vaccine shots and the vaccine platform received, and also depended markedly on prior COVID-19 diagnosis and the days elapsed since last antigen exposure (vaccine shot or natural infection). Following-up 514 participants provided real-world data linking antibody levels with protection against COVID-19 during a period of high risk of exposure to an immune-escaping highly transmissible variant. Pre-wave antibody titres were strongly associated with COVID-19 incidence and severity of symptoms during the wave. Also, receiving a vaccine shot during the follow-up period reduced the COVID-19 risk drastically (15-fold). These results highlight the importance of maintaining high defences through vaccination anticipating or during a period of high risk of exposure to immune-escaping variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by the Agencia Santafesina de Ciencia, Tecnnologia e Innovacion (Grant # DEMES-2020-0008).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Comite de Etica y Seguridad en el Trabajo Experimental del Centro Cientifico Tecnologico CONICET - Santa Fe.

%X Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) can be carried out in the home and have been used as an affordable and practical approach to large-scale antibody prevalence studies. However, assay performance differs from that of high-throughput laboratory-based assays which can be highly sensitive. We explore LFIA performance under field conditions compared to laboratory-based ELISA and assess the potential of LFIAs to identify people who lack functional antibodies following infection or vaccination.Methods Field evaluation of a self-administered LFIA test (Fortress, NI) among 3758 participants from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) study in England selected based on vaccination history and previous LFIA result to ensure a range of antibody titres. In July 2021, participants performed, at home, a self-administered LFIA on finger-prick blood, reported and submitted a photograph of the result, and provided a self-collected capillary blood sample (Tasso-SST) for serological assessment of IgG antibodies to the spike protein using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. We compared the self-administered and reported LFIA result to the quantitative Roche assay and checked the reading of the LFIA result with an automated image analysis (ALFA). In a subsample of 250 participants, we compared the results to live virus neutralisation.Results Almost all participants (3593/3758, 95.6%) had been vaccinated or reported prior infection, with most having received one (862, 22.9%) or two (2430, 64.7%) COVID-19 vaccine doses. Overall, 2777/3758 (73.9%) were positive on self-reported LFIA, 2811/3457 (81.3%) positive by LFIA when ALFA-reported, and 3622/3758 (96.4%) positive on Roche anti-S (using the manufacturer reference standard threshold for positivity of 0.8 U ml-1). Live virus neutralisation was detected in 169 of 250 randomly selected samples (67.6%); 133/169 were positive with self-reported LFIA (sensitivity 78.7%; 95% CI 71.8, 84.6), 142/155 (91.6%; 86.1, 95.5) with ALFA, and 169 (100%; 97.8, 100.0) with Roche anti-S. There were 81 samples with no detectable virus neutralisation; 47/81 were negative with self-reported LFIA (specificity 58.0%; 95% CI 46.5, 68.9), 34/75 (45.3%; 33.8, 57.3) with ALFA, and 0/81 (0%; 0.0, 4.5) with Roche anti-S. All 250 samples remained positive with Roche anti-S when the threshold was increased to 1000U ml-1.Conclusions Self-administered LFIA can provide insights into population patterns of infection and vaccine response, and sensitivity can be improved with automated reading of the result. The LFIA is less sensitive than a quantitative antibody test, but the positivity in LFIA correlates better than the quantitative ELISA with virus neutralisation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work was supported by the Department of Health and Social Care in England.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This work was undertaken as part of the REACT-2 study, with ethical approval from South Central Berkshire B Research Ethics Committee (REC ref: 20/SC/0206; IRAS 283805)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X During a COVID-19 outbreak in a prison in Zambia from 14th to 19th December 2021, a case control study was done to measure vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and symptomatic infection, when the Omicron variant was the dominant circulating variant. Among 382 participants, 74.1% were fully vaccinated and the median time since full vaccination was 54 days. There were no hospitalizations or deaths. COVID-19 VE against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 64.8% and VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 72.9%. COVID-19 vaccination helped protect incarcerated persons against SARS-CoV-2 infection during an outbreak while Omicron was the dominant variant in Zambia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of Excellence in Research Ethics Science converge Zambia gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Both infection and vaccination, alone or in combination, generate antibody and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. However, the maintenance of such responses – and hence protection from disease – requires careful characterisation. In a large prospective study of UK healthcare workers (Protective immunity from T cells in Healthcare workers (PITCH), within the larger SARS-CoV-2 immunity &amp; reinfection evaluation (SIREN) study) we previously observed that prior infection impacted strongly on subsequent cellular and humoral immunity induced after long and short dosing intervals of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccination. Here, we report longer follow up of 684 HCWs in this cohort over 6-9 months following two doses of BNT162b2 or AZD1222 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccination and up to 6 months following a subsequent mRNA booster vaccination. We make three observations: Firstly, the dynamics of humoral and cellular responses differ; binding and neutralising antibodies declined whereas T and memory B cell responses were maintained after the second vaccine dose. Secondly, vaccine boosting restored IgG levels, broadened neutralising activity against variants of concern including omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5, and boosted T cell responses above the 6 month level post dose 2. Thirdly, prior infection maintained its impact driving larger as well as broader T cell responses compared with never-infected people – a feature maintained until 6 months after the third dose. In conclusion, broadly cross-reactive T cell responses are well maintained over time – especially in those with combined vaccine and infection-induced immunity (“hybrid” immunity) – and may contribute to continued protection against severe disease.Competing Interest StatementThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR, the Department of Health and Social Care or Public Health England or the US Food and Drug Administration.

%X Background The progression and severity of the COVID 19 pandemic have been measured based on the daily and total numbers of cases, hospitalisations and deaths. We focused on the nature of hospitalisations from 2020 to 2022.Methods We analysed the role played by SARS-CoV-2 in the pandemic in the UK; we lodged FOI requests to Public Health Wales (PHW), Scotland (PHS), and Northern Ireland (PHA NI), the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and NHS England. We asked for all-cause hospital admission monthly numbers reported by days of positivity to SARS-CoV-2 since admission from March 2020. We grouped replies by respondents. We considered any positive tests acquired from day 8 post admission as evidence of in hospital transmission.Results PHW, PHS and PHA NI, provided data within two months. The proportion of people admitted who became positive after eight or more days was 33% in Northern Ireland, 24% in Scotland and 45% in Wales. There are seasonal fluctuations reflecting community admissions but no evidence that the proportion of those infected in hospitals reduced over time. No authorities had viral load or symptoms data relating to their datasets. Given the limitations in PCR reporting, it is impossible to know how many “positive” cases were active. UKHSA did not hold the data, and NHS England did not clarify the content of its website.Conclusion Aggregate data of “cases of Covid” in hospitals should not be used to inform policy of decision-makers until coordination, and proper interpretation of the dataset are instigated.Competing Interest StatementTJ competing interests are accessible at: https://restoringtrials.org/competing-interests-tom-jefferson CH holds grant funding from the NIHR School of Primary Care Research, the NIHR BRC Oxford, and the World Health Organization for a series of Living rapid reviews on the modes of transmission of SARs-CoV-2 reference WHO registration No2020/1077093.

%X Objectives The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant presents numerous mutations potentially able to evade neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, this study aimed to provide evidence on a heterologous booster strategy to overcome the waning immunity against Omicron variants.Methods Participants who completed Oxford/AstraZeneca (hereafter AZD1222) for 5-7 months were enrolled. The reactogenicity and persistence of immunogenicity in both humoral and cellular response after a homologous or heterologous booster with the AZD1222 and mRNA vaccines (BNT162B2, full or half-dose mRNA-1273) administered six months after primary vaccination were determined.Results Total 229 individuals enrolled, a waning of immunity was observed 5-7 months after the AZD1222-primed. Total RBD immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, anti-RBD IgG and focus reduction neutralization test against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 and T cell response peaked 14-28 days after booster vaccination. Both the full and half dose of mRNA-1273 induced the highest response, followed by BNT162b2 and AZD1222. At 90 days, the persistence of immunogenicity was observed among all mRNA-boosted individuals. Adverse events were acceptable and well tolerated for all vaccines.Conclusions A heterologous mRNA booster provided a significantly superior boost of binding and NAbs levels against the Omicron variant compared to a homologous booster in individuals with AZD1222-primed vaccinations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialTCTR20210910002Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI), National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Chulalongkorn University, and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital and was partially supported by the Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University.

%X The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting unvaccinated, vaccinated and previously-infected individuals due to its ability to evade neutralization by antibodies. With three sub-lineages of Omicron emerging in the last four months, there is inadequate information on the quantitative antibody response generated upon natural infection with Omicron variant and whether these antibodies offer cross-protection against other sub-lineages of Omicron variant. In this study, we characterized the growth kinetics of Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells. Relatively higher amounts infectious virus titers, cytopathic effect and disruption of epithelial barrier functions was observed with Delta variant whereas infection with Omicron variant led to a more robust induction of interferon pathway, lower level of virus replication and mild effect on epithelial barrier. The replication kinetics of BA.1 and BA.2 sub-lineages of the Omicron variant were comparable in cell culture and natural Omicron infection in a subset of individuals led to a significant increase in binding and neutralizing antibodies to both BA.1 and BA.2 sub-lineages but these levels were lower than that produced against the Delta variant. Finally, we show that Cu2+, Zn2+ and Fe2+ salts inhibited in vitro RdRp activity but only Cu2+ and Fe2+ inhibited both the Delta and Omicron variants in cell culture. Thus, our results suggest that high levels of interferons induced upon infection with Omicron variant may counter virus replication and spread. Waning neutralizing antibody titers rendered subjects susceptible to infection by Omicron variant and natural Omicron infection elicits neutralizing antibodies that can cross-react with other sub-lineages of Omicron and other variants of concern.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) grants through IndCEPI Mission (BT/MB/CEPI/2016) and Translational Research Program (BT/PR30159/MED/15/188/2018).

We also built a statistical model to estimate the overall disease burden under various hypothetical mitigation scenarios. We found that due to high transmissibility, neither Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 could be contained by China’s pre-Omicron NPI strategies which were successful prior to the emergence of the Omicron variants. However, increased intervention intensity, such as enhanced population mobility restrictions and multi-round mass testing, could lead to containment success. We estimated that an acute Omicron epidemic wave in mainland China would result in significant number of deaths if China were to reopen under current vaccine coverage with no antiviral uptake, while increasing vaccination coverage and antiviral uptake could substantially reduce the disease burden. As China’s current vaccination has yet to reach high coverage in older populations, NPIs remain essential tools to maintain low levels of infection while building up protective population immunity, ensuring a smooth transition out of the pandemic phase while minimizing the overall disease burden.Competing Interest StatementH.Y. received research funding from Sanofi Pasteur, GlaxoSmithKline, Yichang HEC Changjiang Pharmaceutical Company, Shanghai Roche Pharmaceutical Company, and SINOVAC Biotech Ltd.

%X Large-scale vaccination campaigns have prevented countless hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that escape from immunity challenges the effectiveness of current vaccines. Given this continuing evolution, an important question is when and how to update SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to antigenically match circulating variants, similar to seasonal influenza viruses where antigenic drift necessitates periodic vaccine updates. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 antigenic drift by assessing neutralizing activity against variants-of-concern (VOCs) of a unique set of sera from patients infected with a range of VOCs. Infections with D614G or Alpha strains induced the broadest immunity, while individuals infected with other VOCs had more strain-specific responses. Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were substantially resistant to neutralization by sera elicited by all other variants. Antigenic cartography revealed that Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 are antigenically most distinct from D614G, associated with immune escape and likely requiring vaccine updates to ensure vaccine effectiveness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by: R.W.S. and C.A.R. are recipients of Vici grants from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO no. 91818627 for R.W.S.).

%X Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an effective way of tracking the appearance and spread of SARS-COV-2 lineages through communities. Beginning in early 2021, we implemented a targeted approach to amplify and sequence the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 to characterize viral lineages present in sewersheds. Over the course of 2021, we reproducibly detected multiple SARS-COV-2 RBD lineages that have never been observed in patient samples in 9 sewersheds located in 3 states in the USA. These cryptic lineages contained between 4 to 24 amino acid substitutions in the RBD and were observed intermittently in the sewersheds in which they were found for as long as 14 months. Many of the amino acid substitutions in these lineages occurred at residues also mutated in the Omicron variant of concern (VOC), often with the same substitution. One of the sewersheds contained a lineage that appeared to be derived from the Alpha VOC, but the majority of the lineages appeared to be derived from pre-VOC SARS-COV-2 lineages. Specifically, several of the cryptic lineages from New York City appeared to be derived from a common ancestor that most likely diverged in early 2020. While the source of these cryptic lineages has not been resolved, it seems increasingly likely that they were derived from immunocompromised patients or animal reservoirs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-COV-2 genetic diversity is greater than what is commonly observed through routine SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Wastewater sampling may more fully capture SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity than patient sampling and could reveal new VOCs before they emerge in the wider human population.Author Summary During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology has become an effective public health tool. Because many infected individuals shed SARS-CoV-2 in feces, wastewater has been monitored to reveal infection trends in the sewersheds from which the samples were derived. Here we report novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater samples obtained from 3 different states in the USA. These lineages appeared in specific sewersheds intermittently over periods of up to 14 months, but generally have not been detected beyond the sewersheds in which they were initially found. Many of these lineages may have diverged in early 2020. Although these lineages share considerable overlap with each other, they have never been observed in patients anywhere in the world. While the wastewater lineages have similarities with lineages observed in long-term infections of immunocompromised patients, animal reservoirs cannot be ruled out as a potential source.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project has been funded in part with federal funds from the NIDA/NIH (https://www.nida.nih.gov/) under contract numbers 1U01DA053893-01 to JW and MCJ.

%X Measures to restrict physical inter-personal contact in the community have been widely implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied determinants for infection with SARS-CoV-2 with the aim of testing the efficiency of such measures.We conducted a national matched case-control study among unvaccinated persons aged 18-49 years. Cases were selected among those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR over a five-day period in June 2021. Controls were selected from the national population register and were individually matched on age, sex and municipality of residence and had not previously tested positive. Cases and controls were interviewed via telephone about contact with other persons and exposures in the community. We included 500 cases and 529 controls and determined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) by conditional logistical regression with adjustment for household size and immigration status.We found having had contact with another individual with a known infection as the main determinant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reporting close contact with an infected person who either had or did not have symptoms resulted in ORs of 20 (95%CI:9.8-39) and 8.5 (95%CI 4.5-16) respectively. In contrast, community exposures were generally not associated with disease; several exposures were negatively associated. Exceptions were: attending fitness centers, OR=1.4 (95%CI:1.0-2.0) and consumption of alcohol in restaurants or cafés, OR=2.3 (95%CI:1.3–4.2).For reference, we provide a timeline of non-pharmaceutical interventions in place in Denmark from February 2020 to March 2022. Fitness centers and alcohol consumption were mildly associated with infection, in agreement with findings of our similar study conducted six month earlier (Epidemiology &amp; Infection 2021;150:e9.). Transmission of disease through involvement in community activities appeared to occur only rarely, suggesting that community restrictions in place were efficient. Instead, transmission appeared to primarily take place in a confined space via contact to known persons.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe author(s) received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was performed as a national disease surveillance project, registered with the Danish Data Protection Agency (reg no 21/04112) and specifically approved regarding legal, ethical and cyber-security issues.

%X Background Over one million COVID-19 deaths have been recorded in the United States. Sustained global SARS-CoV-2 transmission has led to the emergence of new variants with increased transmissibility, virulence, and/or immune evasion. The specific burden of mortality from each variant over the course of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic remains unclear.Methods We constructed an epidemiologic model using data reported by the CDC on COVID-19 mortality and circulating variant proportions to estimate the number of recorded COVID-19 deaths attributable to each SARS-CoV-2 variant in the U.S. We conducted sensitivity analysis to account for parameter uncertainty.Findings Of the 1,003,419 COVID-19 deaths recorded as of May 12, 2022, we estimate that 460,124 (46%) were attributable to WHO-designated variants. By U.S. Census Region, the South recorded the most variant deaths per capita (median estimate 158 per 100,000), while the Northeast recorded the fewest (111 per 100,000). Over 40 percent of national COVID-19 deaths were estimated to be caused by the combination of Alpha (median estimate 39,548 deaths), Delta (273,801), and Omicron (117,560).Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged around the world have imposed a significant mortality burden in the U.S. In addition to national public health strategies, greater efforts are needed to lower the risk of new variants emerging, including through global COVID-19 vaccination, treatment, and outbreak mitigation.Competing Interest StatementN.D.G. is a consultant for Tempus Labs and the National Basketball Association for work related to COVID-19 but is outside the submitted work.

%X Homologous and heterologous booster with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines represent the most effective strategy to prevent the ongoing Omicron pandemic. The additional protection from these prototype SARS-CoV-2 S-targeting vaccine was attributed to the increased RBD-specific memory B cells with expanded potency and breadth. Herein, we show the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous boosting with the RBD-targeting mRNA vaccine AWcorna (also term ARCoV) in Chinese adults who have received two doses inactivated vaccine. The superiority over inactivated vaccine in neutralization antibodies, as well as the safety profile, support the use of AWcorna as heterologous booster in China.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialChiCTR2100053701Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by grant from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2302400) and the National Science Foundation of China (82151222).

%T SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Rwanda: Introductions and local transmission of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of concern

%X The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant of concern (lineage B.1.617.2) in late 2020 resulted in a new wave of infections in many countries across the world, where it often became the dominant lineage in a relatively short amount of time. We here report on a novel genomic surveillance effort in Rwanda in the time period from June to September 2021, leading to 201 SARS-CoV-2 genomes being generated, the majority of which were identified as the Delta variant of concern. We show that in Rwanda, the Delta variant almost completely replaced the previously dominant A.23.1 and B.1.351 (Beta) lineages in a matter of weeks, and led to a tripling of the total number of COVID-19 infections and COVID-19-related fatalities over the course of only three months. We estimate that Delta in Rwanda had an average growth rate advantage of 0.034 (95% CI 0.025-0.045) per day over A.23.1, and of 0.022 (95% CI 0.012-0.032) over B.1.351. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of at least seven local Delta transmission clusters, with two of these clusters occurring close to the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and another cluster close to the border with Tanzania. A smaller Delta cluster of infections also appeared close to the border with Uganda, illustrating the importance of monitoring cross-border traffic to limit the spread between Rwanda and its neighboring countries. We discuss our findings against a background of increased vaccination efforts in Rwanda, and also discuss a number of breakthrough infections identified during our study. Concluding, our study has added an important collection of data to the available genomes for the Eastern Africa region, with the number of Delta infections close to the border with neighboring countries highlighting the need to further strengthen genomic surveillance in the region to obtain a better understanding of the impact of border crossings on lowering the epidemic curve in Rwanda.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe would like to acknowledge the work of Christian Happi, Enatha Mukantwari, Idowu Olawoye, Paul Oluniyi, Umuringa Jeanne D arc, Esperance Umumararungu, Arlene Uwituze and Onikepe Folarin.

%X Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Millions of people have fallen sick, and some have died due to this affliction that has spread across the globe. The current pandemic has disrupted normal day-to-day human life, causing a profound social and economic burden. Vaccination is an important control measure that could significantly reduce the incidence of cases and mortality if properly and efficiently distributed. In this work, an age-structured model of COVID-19 transmission, incorporating an unreported infectious compartment, is developed. Three age groups are considered, namely: young (0-19 years), adult (20-64 years), and elderly (65+ years). The transmission and reporting rates are determined for each group by utilizing the number of COVID-19 cases in the National Capital Region in the Philippines.

Further, three different vaccination periods are considered to reflect phases of vaccination priority groups: the first, second, and third account for the inoculation of the elderly, adult and elderly, and all three age groups, respectively.

%X While numerous diagnostic tests for COVID-19 have been developed for clinical and public health use, most of them provide binary or one-dimensional information on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pursuit of speed and ease of use. As their readouts are largely dependent on the specimen collection procedure, reliable diagnosis is still difficult. Here we report the development of a prototypical method for the immunocytochemical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection using oral specimens and fluorescent nanobodies against the viral spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Our cytological approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection was validated by our finding that at least half of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in oral specimens were localized in the cellular fraction. Mapping antigens on sampled cells provided qualitative image data to which appropriate statistical texture analysis could be applied for the quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infectious status. A comprehensive comparative analysis revealed that oral cavity swabbing by medical workers provides specimens for COVID-19 diagnosis that yield comparable diagnostic accuracy as self-collected saliva specimens. Our diagnostic strategy may enable medical workers to acquire a wealth of information on virus–human cell interactions for multifaceted insight into COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementS. S, M.

%X Background Variant-adaptated vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as boosters are needed to increase a broader protection against SARS CoV-2 variants. New adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccines as heterologous boosters could maximize the response.Methods In this randomized, single-blinded, multicenter trial, adults who had received two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) 3 to7 months before were randomly assigned to receive a boost of BNT162b2, Sanofi/GSK SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein MV D614 (monovalent parental formulation) or SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein MV B.1.351 vaccine (monovalent Beta formulation). The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects with a ≥10-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers for the Wuhan (D614) and B.1.351 (Beta) SARS-CoV-2 viral strains between day 0 and day 15.Findings The percentages of participants whose neutralizing antibody titers against the Wuhan (D614) SARS-CoV-2 strain increased by a factor ≥10 between day 0 and day 15 was 55.3% (95% CI 43.4-66.7) in MV D614 group (n=76), 76.1% (64.5-85.4) in MV B.1.351 (Beta) group (n=71) and 63.2% (51.3-73.9) in BNT162b2 group (n=76). These percentages were 44.7% (33.3-56.6), 84.5% (74.0-92.0) and 51.3% (39.6-63.0) for the B.1.351 (Beta) viral strain, respectively. Higher neutralizing antibodies rates against Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants were also elicited after Sanofi/GSK MV Beta vaccine compared to the other vaccines. Comparable reactogenicity profile was observed with the three vaccines.Interpretation Heterologous boosting with the Sanofi/GSK Beta formulation vaccine resulted in a higher neutralizing antibody response against Beta variant but also the original strain and Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants, compared with mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine or the Sanofi/GSK MVD614 formulation. New vaccines containing Beta spike protein may represent an interesting strategy for broader protection against SARS CoV-2 variants.Funding French Ministries of Solidarity and Health and Research and SanofiTrial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05124171; EudraCT identifier 2021-004550-33.Competing Interest StatementOdile Launay - AstraZeneca (Financial) - GlaxoSmithKline (Advisor/Consultant, Grant/Research Support) - Johnson &amp; Johnson (Advisor/Consultant, Grant/Research Support) - MD (Advisor/Consultant) - Moderna (Advisor/Consultant) - MSD (Data safety monitoring board) - Pfizer (Advisor/Consultant, Grant/Research Support) - Sanofi Pasteur (Advisor/Consultant, Grant/Research Support, Data safety monitoring board) Tabassome Simone: -DGOS (French Ministry of health), Astrazeneca, Bayer, Novartis, Sanofi, Boehringer, Daiichi Sankyo, Eli Lilly, GSK: grant -Astrazeneca, Sanofi, Bayer, Ablative Solutions and 4 Living Biotech: personal fees for boardmembership and consulting Karine Lacombe: - Gilead, MSD, Janssen, ViiV, Spikimm (fees and Grant/Research Support) -Janssen, Gilead, MSD, Sobi, and Chiesi (fees for development of educational presentations).

%X Unlike mRNA vaccines based only on the Spike protein, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should induce a diversified T cell response recognizing distinct structural proteins. Here we performed a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells in healthy individuals following vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or mRNA vaccines. Relative to Spike mRNA vaccination, inactivated vaccines elicited a lower magnitude of Spike-specific T cells, but the combined Membrane, Nucleoprotein and Spike-specific T cell response was quantitatively comparable to the sole Spike T cell response induced by mRNA vaccines, and they efficiently tolerate the mutations characterizing the Omicron lineage. However, this multi-protein specific T cell response was not mediated by a coordinated CD4 and CD8 T cell expansion but by selected priming of CD4 T cells. These findings can help in defining the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the efficacy of the different vaccines to control severe COVID-19 after Omicron infection.Competing Interest StatementA.T.

%X Background Omicron variant strain dominated since the beginning of 2022. Its infectivity was supposes to be higher than Delta variant strain or strains in past.Object We estimated prevalence of omicron variant strain, particularly bA.2 variant and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness of the third dose in Japan as well as controlling for waning of second dose of vaccine, other mutated strains, the Olympic Games, and countermeasures.Method The effective reproduction number R(t) was regressed on shares of omicron variant strain and bA.2 and vaccine coverage of the third dose, as well as along with data of temperature, humidity, mobility, share of the other mutated strains, and an Olympic Games and countermeasures. The study period was February, 2020 through February 21, 2022, as of March 15, 2022.Results Estimation results indicated that waning of the second dose vaccine e with 150 days prior was the most appropriate specification. Moreover, bA.2 of omicron variant strain has higher infectively than other variant strain or traditional strain.Discussion Because of data limitation since emerging bA.2, the estimated its infectively will change over time.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All information used for this study has been published.

%X Population-level immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is growing through vaccination as well as ongoing circulation. Given waning immunity and emergence of new variants, it is important to dynamically determine the risk of re-infection in the population. For estimating immune protection, neutralization titers are most informative, but these assays are difficult to conduct at a population level. Measurement of antibody levels can be implemented at high throughput, but has not been robustly validated as a correlate of protection. Here, we have developed a method that predicts neutralization and protection based on variant-specific antibody measurements to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This approach allowed us to estimate population-immunity in a longitudinal cohort from France followed for up to 2 years. Participants with a single vaccination or immunity caused by infection only are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 or hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2. While the median reduced risk to COVID-19 in participants with 3 vaccinations was 96%, the median reduced risk among participants with infection-acquired immunity only was 42%. The results presented here are consistent with data from vaccine-effectiveness studies indicating robustness of our approach. Our multiplex serological assay can be readily optimized and employed to study any new variant and provides a framework for development of an assay that would include protection estimates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (CorPopImm to MW), and the French Governments Laboratoire d'Excellence Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases(Investissement dAvenir grant ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID), and INCEPTION programs (Investissement dAvenir grant ANR-16-CONV-0005), and URGENCE COVID-19 fundraising campaign of Institut Pasteur (TooLab project awarded to M.B.).

%X As has been consistently demonstrated, rapid tests administered at regular intervals can offer significant benefits to both individuals and their communities at large by helping identify whether an individual is infected and potentially infectious. An additional advantage to the tested individuals is that positive tests may be provided sufficiently early enough during their infections that treatment with antiviral treatments can effectively inhibit development of severe disease, particularly when PCR uptake is limited and/or delays to receipt of results are substantial. Here, we provide a quantitative illustration of the extent to which rapid tests administered at various intervals can deliver benefits accrued from the novel Pfizer treatment (nirmatrelvir) among high-risk populations. We find that strategies in which tests are administered more frequently, i.e. every other day or every three days, are associated with greater reductions in the risk of hospitalization with weighted risk ratios ranging from 0.17 (95% CI: 0.11-0.28) to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69-0.83) and correspondingly, higher proportions of the infected population benefiting from treatment, ranging from 0.26 (95% CI: 0.18-0.34) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.80-0.98). We further observed that reduced positive-test-to-treatment delays and increased testing and treatment coverage have a critical influence on average treatment benefits, confirming the significance of access.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Identification and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern/Interest (VOC/VOIs) is essential to guide public health measures. We report the surveillance of VOCs circulating in Karachi during the pandemic between April 2021 and February 2022. We screened 2150 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples received at the AKUH Clinical Laboratories. VOC was identified using a PCR-based approach targeting lineage-specific mutations using commercially available assays. Of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples, 81.7% had VOC/VOI, while 18.3% were undetermined. Alpha variants were predominant at 82.5% and 40.3% of the cases in April and May 2021. Beta variants increased in May (29%) and June (42%) and then reduced to 6% by July. Gamma variant cases were at 14.5% and 9% in May and June, respectively. Delta variants first detected in May, increased to comprise 66% of all variants by July, remaining dominant in August, September, October, and November 2021 at 88%, 91%, 91% and 85% respectively. Omicron (BA.1) variants emerged in December, rising to 42% of cases with an increase to 81% by January 2022 and then reducing to 45% in February 2022. Delta variant prevalence was coincident with increased hospital admissions and mortality. The Omicron variant surge was associated with increased daily infections but limited COVID-19 severity. We highlight the predominance of the VOCs identified through a rapid PCR based approach. As this is important to inform a public health response, we propose that a mutation targeted approach can be a rapid, lower cost solution to aid tracking of known VOCs during pandemic waves.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study received support through; University Research Council Grant, Aga Khan University, Pakistan; Rapid Research Grant-236, Higher Education Commission Pakistan and the World Health Organization, Pakistan.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee, Aga Khan University.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infections are common among individuals who are vaccinated or have recovered from prior variant infection, but few reports have documented serial Omicron infections. We characterized SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses in a healthy young person who acquired laboratory-confirmed Omicron BA.1.15 ten weeks after a third dose of BNT162b2, and BA.2 thirteen weeks later. Responses were compared to those of 124 COVID-19 naive vaccinees. One month after the second and third vaccine doses, the participant’s wild-type and BA.1-specific IgG, ACE2 competition and virus neutralization activities were average for a COVID-19 naive triple-vaccinated individual. BA.1 infection boosted the participant’s responses to the cohort ≥95th percentile, but even this strong “hybrid” immunity failed to protect against BA.2. Moreover, reinfection increased BA.1 and BA.2-specific responses only modestly. Results illustrate the risk of Omicron infection in fully vaccinated individuals and highlight the importance of personal and public health measures as vaccine-induced immune responses wane.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding info is included in the manuscript.

%X Currently available mRNA vaccines are extremely safe and effective to prevent severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the emergence of novel variants of concerns has highlighted the importance of high population-based vaccine rates to effectively suppress viral transmission and breakthrough infections. While initially left out from vaccine efforts, children have become one of the most affected age groups and are key targets to stop community and household spread. Antibodies are central for vaccine induced protection and emerging data points to the importance of additional Fc effector functions like opsononophagocytosis or cytotoxicity, particularly in the context of variants of concern that escape neutralizing antibodies. Here, we observed delayed induction and reduced magnitude of vaccine induced antibody titers in children 5-11 years receiving two doses of the age recommended 10 μg dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine compared to adolescents (12-15 years) or adults receiving the 30 μg dose. Conversely, children mounted equivalent or more robust neutralization and opsonophagocytic functions at peak immunogenicity, pointing to a qualitatively more robust humoral functional response in children. Moreover, broad cross-variants of concern responses were observed across children, with enhanced IgM and parallel IgG cross-reactivity to variants of concern (VOCs) in children compared to adults. Collectively, these data argue that despite the lower magnitude of the BNT162b2 induced antibody response in children, vaccine induced immunity in children target VOCs broadly and exhibit enhanced functionality that may contribute to attenuation of disease.Competing Interest StatementG.A. is a founder of Seromyx Systems, a company developing a platform technology that describes the antibody immune response.

%X Rapid recognition of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by T cells resident in the upper airway might provide an important layer of protection against COVID-19. Whether parenchymal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection induce nasal resident T cells specific for distinct SARS-CoV-2 proteins is unknown. We collected T cells from the nasal secretion of COVID-19 vaccinees, who either experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination (n=20) or not (n=15) and analyzed their phenotype, SARS-CoV-2 specificity and function. Nasal-resident IFN-γ producing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells were detected exclusively in vaccinees who experienced SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection. Importantly, the vaccine priming of Spike-specific T cells does not suppress the induction of CD8 and CD4 T cells specific for different SARS-CoV-2 proteins (i.e. NP and NSP-12) that persisted in the nasal cavity up to 3 months after infection. These data highlight the importance of viral nasal challenge in the formation of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral immunity at the site of primary infection and further define the immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 hybrid immunity.Competing Interest StatementN.

%X England has experienced a heavy burden of COVID-19, with multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 transmission since early 2020 and high infection levels following the emergence and spread of Omicron variants since late 2021. In response to rising Omicron cases, booster vaccinations were accelerated and offered to all adults in England. Using a model fitted to more than 2 years of epidemiological data, we project potential dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospital admissions and deaths in England to December 2022. We consider key uncertainties including future behavioural change and waning immunity, and assess the effectiveness of booster vaccinations in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 disease burden between October 2021 and December 2022. If no new variants emerge, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is expected to decline, with low levels remaining in the coming months. The extent to which projected SARS-CoV-2 transmission resurges later in 2022 depends largely on assumptions around waning immunity and to some extent, behaviour and seasonality.Competing Interest StatementRCB, NGD, MJ and WJE are participants of the UK's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling.

%X The impact of vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness is not well understood. We compared longitudinal viral shedding dynamics in unvaccinated and fully vaccinated adults. SARS-CoV-2-infected adults were enrolled within 5 days of symptom onset and nasal specimens were self-collected daily for two weeks and intermittently for an additional two weeks. SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and infectious virus were analyzed relative to symptom onset stratified by vaccination status. We tested 1080 nasal specimens from 52 unvaccinated adults enrolled in the pre-Delta period and 32 fully vaccinated adults with predominantly Delta infections. While we observed no differences by vaccination status in maximum RNA levels, maximum infectious titers and the median duration of viral RNA shedding, the rate of decay from the maximum RNA load was faster among vaccinated; maximum infectious titers and maximum RNA levels were highly correlated. Furthermore, amongst participants with infectious virus, median duration of infectious virus detection was reduced from 7.5 days (IQR: 6.0-9.0) in unvaccinated participants to 6 days (IQR: 5.0-8.0) in those vaccinated (P=0.02). Accordingly, the odds of shedding infectious virus from days 6 to 12 post-onset were lower among vaccinated participants than unvaccinated participants (OR 0.42 95% CI 0.19-0.89). These results indicate that vaccination had reduced the probability of shedding infectious virus after 5 days from symptom onset.Significance statement We present longitudinal data on the magnitude, duration and decay rate of viral RNA and the magnitude and duration of infectious virus in nasal specimens from vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. On average, vaccinated participants (infected with the highly transmissible Delta variant) showed a lower probability of having infectious virus after 5 days of symptoms compared to unvaccinated participants (infected with mostly pre-delta viral lineages), even though both groups had a similar magnitude of infectious virus at or near the peak. These data help improve our understanding of the duration of the infectious period when infection occurs following vaccination and serves as a reference for future studies of shedding dynamics following infections with novel variants of concern.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Broad Agency Announcement.

%X Multiple lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) have emerged, and BA.1 and BA.2 have demonstrated substantial escape from neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). BA.2.12.1 has now become dominant in the United States, and BA.4 and BA.5 have become dominant in South Africa. Our data show that BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 substantially escape NAbs induced by both vaccination and infection. Moreover, BA.4/BA.5 NAb titers, and to lesser extent BA.2.12.1 NAb titers, were lower than BA.1 and BA.2 NAb titers, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has continued to evolve with increasing neutralization escape. These findings have important public health implications and provide immunologic context for the current surges with BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 in populations with high rates of vaccination and BA.1/BA.2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors acknowledge NIH grant CA260476, the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness, the Ragon Institute, and the Musk Foundation (D.H.B.), as well as the Reproductive Scientist Development Program from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development and Burroughs Wellcome Fund HD000849 and NIH grant AI69309 (A.Y.C.).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:IRB of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X BACKGROUND While emerging data during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have demonstrated robust mRNA vaccine-induced immunogenicity across populations, including pregnant and lactating individuals, the rapid waning of vaccine-induced immunity and the emergence of variants of concern motivated the use of mRNA vaccine booster doses. Whether all populations, including pregnant and lactating individuals, will mount a comparable response to a booster dose is not known.OBJECTIVE We sought to profile the humoral immune response to a COVID-19 mRNA booster dose in a cohort of pregnant, lactating, and age-matched nonpregnant women.STUDY DESIGN We characterized the antibody response against ancestral Spike and Omicron in a cohort of 31 pregnant, 12 lactating and 20 nonpregnant age-matched controls who received a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 booster dose after primary COVID-19 vaccination. We also examined the vaccine-induced antibody profiles of 15 maternal:cord dyads at delivery.RESULTS Receipt of a booster dose during pregnancy resulted in increased IgG1 against Omicron Spike (post-primary vaccination vs post-booster, p = 0.03). Pregnant and lactating individuals exhibited equivalent Spike-specific total IgG1, IgM and IgA levels and neutralizing titers against Omicron compared to nonpregnant women. Subtle differences in Fc-receptor binding and antibody subclass profiles were observed in the immune response to a booster dose in pregnant compared to nonpregnant individuals. Analysis of maternal and cord antibody profiles at delivery demonstrated equivalent total Spike-specific IgG1 in maternal and cord blood, yet higher Spike-specific FcγR3a-binding antibodies in the cord relative to maternal blood (p = 0.002), consistent with preferential transfer of highly functional IgG. Spike-specific IgG1 levels in the cord were positively correlated with time elapsed since receipt of the booster dose (Spearman R 0.574, p = 0.035).CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that receipt of a booster dose during pregnancy induces a robust Spike-specific humoral immune response, including against Omicron. If boosting occurs in the third trimester, higher Spike-specific cord IgG1 levels are achieved with greater time elapsed between receipt of the booster and delivery. Receipt of a booster dose has the potential to augment maternal and neonatal immunity.Competing Interest StatementK.J.G. has consulted for Illumina, BillionToOne, Aetion, and Roche outside the scope of the submitted work.

%X Introduction Antigen testing is essential in the clinical management of COVID-19. However, most evaluations of antigen tests have been performed before the emergence of the Omicron variant. Thus, an assessment of the diagnostic performance of antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the circulation of Omicron variant is required.Methods This prospective observational study evaluated QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag, a rapid antigen detection test between December 2021 and February 2022 in Japan, using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as a reference. Two nasopharyngeal samples were simultaneously collected for antigen testing and for RT-PCR. Variant analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing was also performed.Results In total, nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 1,073 participants (417 positive; 919 symptomatic; 154 asymptomatic) for analysis. Compared with those of RT-PCR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 94.2% (95% CI: 91.6%–96.3%), 99.5% (95% CI: 98.7%–99.9%), 99.2% (95% CI: 97.8%–99.8%), and 96.5% (95% CI: 94.8%–97.7%), respectively. The sensitivity among symptomatic individuals was 94.3% (95% CI: 91.5%–96.4%). Overall, 85.9% of sequences were classified as Omicron sublineage BA.1, 12.4% were Omicron sublineage BA.2, and 1.6% were Delta B.1.617.2. (Delta variant). Most of the samples (87.1%) had Ct values &lt;25.Conclusions The QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag test showed high diagnostic performance for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages BA.1 and BA.2 from nasopharyngeal samples.Competing Interest StatementDenka Co., Ltd. provided funds for research expenses and the QuickNavi-Flu+COVID19 Ag and QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag tests without charge.

%X The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted a need for easy and safe blood sampling in combination with accurate serological methodology. Venipuncture is usually performed by trained staff at health care centers. Long travel distances may introduce a bias of testing towards relatively large communities with close access to health care centers. Rural regions may thus be overlooked. Here, we demonstrate a sensitive method to measure antibodies to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. We adapted and optimized this assay for clinical use together with capillary blood sampling to meet the geographical challenges of serosurveillance. Finally, we tested remote at-home capillary blood sampling together with centralized assessment of S-specific IgG in a rural region of northern Scandinavia that encompasses 55,185 sq kilometers. We conclude that serological assessment from capillary blood sampling gives comparable results as analysis of venous blood. Importantly, at-home sampling enabled citizens living in remote rural areas access to centralized and sensitive laboratory antibody tests.Competing Interest StatementJWB, JN and MF are founders and share-holders of Xerum AB.Funding StatementFunding was through grants from Vinnova (2020-03103) to Xerum AB and MF, The Swedish Research Council (2020-06235), Umea University (FS 2.1.6-1233-20) and from the SciLifeLab National COVID-19 Research Program (C19VE:007), financed by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation to MF; the Swedish Research Council (2021-04665) and Region Vasterbotten (REF) to CA.

%X Timely and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) is urgently needed for pandemic surveillance and control. However, current methods are limited by the low sensitivity, long turn-around time or high cost. Here, we report a nucleic acid testing-based method aiming to detect and discriminate SARS-CoV-2 VOCs by combining RT-RPA and CRISPR-Cas12a detecting assays (RRCd). With a detection limit of 10 copies RNA/reaction, RRCd was validated in 204 clinical samples, showing 99% positive predictive agreement and 100% negative predictive agreement, respectively. Critically, using specific crRNAs, representatives of single nucleotide polymorphisms and small deletions in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs including N501Y, T478K and ΔH69-V70 were discriminated by RRCd, demonstrating 100% accuracy in clinical samples with Ct &lt; 33. The method completes within 65 min and could offer visible results without using any electrical devices, which may facilitate point-of-care testing of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.Competing Interest StatementG.Y.T., W.T., G.P.Z. and W.Z. are co-inventors on patent applications filed by Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology relating to the work in this manuscript.

%X While SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination has been shown to be safe and effective in the general population, immunocompromised solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) were reported to have impaired immune responses after one or two doses of vaccine. In this study, we examined humoral responses induced after the second and the third dose of mRNA vaccine in different SOTR (kidney, liver, lung and heart). Compared to a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naïve immunocompetent health care workers (HCW), the second dose induced weak humoral responses in SOTR, except for the liver recipients. The third dose boosted these responses but they did not reach the same level as in HCW. Interestingly, while the neutralizing activity against Delta and Omicron variants remained very low after the third dose, Fc-mediated effector functions in SOTR reached similar levels as in the HCW cohort. Whether these responses will suffice to protect SOTR from severe outcome remains to be determined.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by le Ministere de l Economie et de l Innovation du Quebec, Programme de soutien aux organismes de recherche et d innovation to A.F. and by the Fondation du CHUM.

%X Low-volume antibody assays can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in settings where active testing for virus is limited and remote sampling is optimal. We developed 12 ELISAs detecting total or antibody isotypes to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, spike protein or its receptor binding domain (RBD), 3 anti-RBD isotype specific luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assays and a novel Spike-RBD bridging LIPS total-antibody assay. We utilised pre-pandemic (n=984) and confirmed/suspected recent COVID-19 sera taken pre-vaccination rollout in 2020 (n=269). Assays measuring total antibody discriminated best between pre-pandemic and COVID-19 sera and were selected for diagnostic evaluation. In the blind evaluation, two of these assays (Spike Pan ELISA and Spike-RBD Bridging LIPS assay) demonstrated &gt;97% specificity and &gt;92% sensitivity for samples from COVID-19 patients taken &gt;21 days post symptom onset or PCR test. These assays offered better sensitivity for the detection of COVID-19 cases than a commercial assay which requires 100-fold larger serum volumes. This study demonstrates that low-volume in-house antibody assays can provide good diagnostic performance, and highlights the importance of using well-characterised samples and controls for all stages of assay development and evaluation. These cost-effective assays may be particularly useful for seroprevalence studies in low and middle-income countries.Funding This work was supported by multiple grants to AH, AL, OF, AT, IB awarded by the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute, and funded in part by the Wellcome Trust [Grant number 204813/Z/16/Z] with additional support from Bristol Alumni and Friends.

PCR confirmed and clinically suspected severe COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital were recruited into the DISCOVER study at North Bristol NHS Trust for which HRA Approval was granted by the South Yorkshire Research Ethics Committee (20/YH/0121). Clinical and demographic features were recorded during the in-patient stay and subsequently at out-patient follow-up clinics. Respiratory samples were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing on admission or first presentation; further samples were tested where initial samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Serum or plasma samples were collected at various time points during in-patient and out-patient follow-up. In addition, healthcare workers (HCWs) at University Hospitals Bristol, North Bristol NHS Trust and Weston NHS Foundation Trust who had a previous positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR were invited to donate blood samples under the Bristol Biobank (NHS Research Ethics Committee Ref 20/WA/0273). A clinical data form was used to collect details of symptoms, tests and other information relating to the donor and their COVID-19 status at the point of sampling. A subset of donors was invited back for a repeat donation at &gt;12 weeks post symptom onset. Pre-pandemic samples Samples collected prior to December 2019 were sourced from various collections held in Bristol as detailed in the Table 3 below. All samples were used in accordance with the Human Tissue Act (2004) with appropriate consent and ethical approvals in place. Samples from a longitudinal cohort of keyworkers collected during the pandemic Patient-facing clinical staff members working regularly in the Childrens Emergency Department (CED) of Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, including doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants were invited to take part in the LOGIC (LOnGItudinal Study of COVID-19: Symptoms, Virology &amp; Immunity) study in April 2020; REC reference number 20/YH/0148.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic likely began by viral spillover from animals to humans1-3; today multiple animal species are known to be susceptible to infection4-8. White-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus are infected in North America at substantial levels9-11, and genomic data suggests that a variant in deer may have spilled back to humans12,13. Here we characterize SARS-CoV-2 in deer from Pennsylvania (PA) sampled during fall and winter 2021. Of 123 nasal swab samples analyzed by RT-qPCR, 20 (16.3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Seven whole-genome sequences were obtained, together with six more partial spike sequences. These annotated as alpha and delta variants, the first reported observations of these lineages in deer, documenting multiple new jumps from humans to deer. The alpha lineage persisted in deer after its displacement by delta in humans, and deer-derived alpha variants diverged significantly from those in humans, consistent with a distinctive evolutionary trajectory in deer.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by the Penn University Research Foundation.

%X Background Australia implemented an mRNA-based booster vaccination strategy against the COVID-19 Omicron variant in November 2021. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the booster strategy over 180 days.Methods We developed a decision-analytic Markov model of COVID-19 to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a booster strategy (administered 3 months after 2nd dose) in those aged ≥16 years in Australia from a healthcare system perspective. The willingness-to-pay threshold was chosen as A$ 50,000.Findings Compared with 2-doses of COVID-19 vaccines without a booster, Australia’s booster strategy would incur an additional cost of A$0.88 billion but save A$1.28 billion in direct medical cost and gain 670 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in 180 days of its implementation. This suggested the booster strategy is cost-saving, corresponding to a benefit-cost ratio of 1.45 and a net monetary benefit of A$0.43 billion. The strategy would prevent 1.32 million new infections, 65,170 hospitalisations, 6,927 ICU admissions and 1,348 deaths from COVID-19 in 180 days. Further, a universal booster strategy of having all individuals vaccinated with the booster shot immediately once their eligibility is met would have resulted in a gain of 1,599 QALYs, a net monetary benefit of A$1.46 billion and a benefit-cost ratio of 1.95 in 180 days.Interpretation The COVID-19 booster strategy implemented in Australia is likely to be effective and cost-effective for the Omicron epidemic. Universal booster vaccination would have further improved its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.Funding National Natural Science Foundation of China.

%T Antibody responses to AZD1222 vaccination in West Africa

%X Background There are no real world data on vaccine elicited neutralising antibody responses for the world’s most widely used vaccine, AZD1222, in African populations following scale up. Here, we measured i) baseline SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and levels of protective neutralizing antibodies prior to vaccination rollout using both flow cytometric based analysis of binding antibodies to nucleocapsid (N), coupled with virus neutralisation approaches and ii) neutralizing antibody responses to VOC prior to vaccination (January 2021) and after two-doses of AZD1222 vaccine administered with a 12 week interval in Lagos, Nigeria - a period when the Delta variant was circulating.Methods Health workers at multiple sites in Lagos were recruited to the study. For binding antibody measurement, IgG antibodies against SARS-COV-2 Wuhan-1 receptor-binding domain (RBD), trimeric spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N) and Omicron S1 were measured using the Luminex-based SARS-CoV-2-IgG assay by flow cytometry. For plasma neutralising antibody measurement, SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudovirus (PV) were prepared by transfecting 293T cells with Wuhan-614G wild type (WT), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and BA.1 (Omicron) plasmids in conjunction with HIV-1 expression vectors and luciferase encoding genome flanked by LTRs. We performed serial plasma dilutions from each time point and mixed plasma with PV before infecting HeLa-ACE2 cell lines, reading out luminescence and calculating ID50 (reciprocal dilution of sera required to inhibit 50% of PV infection).Results Our underlying study population receiving at least one dose of vaccine comprised 140 participants with a median age of 40 (interquartile range: 33, 48). 62/140 (44%) participants were anti-N IgG positive prior to administration of first vaccine dose. 49 had plasma samples available at baseline prior to vaccination and at two follow-up timepoints post two dose vaccination for neutralization assays. Half of the participants, 25/49 (51%) were IgG anti-N positive at baseline. Of the 24 individuals anti-N Ab negative at baseline, 12/24 had ID50 above the cut-off of 20. In these individuals, binding antibodies to S were also detectable, and neutralisation correlated with IgG anti-S, suggesting waning of N antibody after infection. Overall, neutralizing Ab titres to WT 1 month after second dose were 2579 and at 3 months post second-dose were 1695. As expected, lower levels of neutralization were observed against the Delta GMT 549 and Omicron variants 269 at 1 month. Positive anti-N IgG Ab status at baseline was associated with significantly higher titres of neutralizing antibodies following vaccination across all tested VOC. Those with anti-N Abs present at baseline did not experience waning of responses between months 1 and 3 post second dose. When data were analysed for negative anti-N IgG status at any timepoint, there was a significant decline in neutralization and binding antibodies between 1 month and 3 months post second-dose. The GMT in these individuals for Delta and Omicron was approximately 100, nearly a log lower in comparison to WT. We tested anti-N IgG in subjects who were anti-N IgG negative at baseline (n=78) and became positive between 1- and 3-months post second dose and found 7/49 (14%) with de-novo infection, with one additional participant demonstrating both reinfection and breakthrough infection to yield a total breakthrough rate of 8/49 (16%). Neutralising and binding Ab titres 1 month post vaccine, prior to breakthrough, were not associated with breakthrough infection. Neutralizing titres were higher at the last time point in individuals who had experienced vaccine breakthrough infection (with no evidence of infection prior to vaccine), indicating a boosting effect of infection in addition to vaccine. However, neutralisation and binding S antibodies against Omicron were low in those with either prior exposure or infection following two dose AZD1222.Conclusions AZD1222 is immunogenic in this real world west African cohort with significant background seroprevalence and incidence of breakthrough infection over a short time period. Prior infection and breakthrough infection induced higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab responses at 3 months post vaccine against all widely circulating VOC. However, responses to Omicron BA.1 were low at three months regardless of hybrid immunity from prior exposure or breakthrough infection. Booster doses after AZD1222 should be considered in the African setting, even after natural infection, as future variants may be more pathogenic as well as immune evasive in the context of waning immunity.Competing Interest StatementRG has received honoraria for educational activities from Janssen, Moderna, and GSK.Funding StatementA.A. is supported by Africa Research Excellence Fund Research Development Fellowship AREF-318-ABDUL-F-C0882.

%X Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was predicted to be severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but the actual data seem to have contradicted these forecasts. This study attempted to verify this observation by comparing predictions against actual data on the spread and burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA.Methods Focused on the period from March 1st to September 30th, 2020, we compared (1) the predicted interval dates when each SSA country would report 1 000 and 10 000 COVID-19 cases, to the actual dates when these numbers were attained, as well as (2) the daily number of predicted versus actual COVID-19 cases.Further, we calculated the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 infection in SSA, and the correlation coefficient between the weekly average number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by each country and the weekly average stringency index of its anti-COVID-19 policy measures.Results 84.61% (33) and 100% (39) of the 39 SSA countries for which predictions were made did not reach a total of 1 000 and 10 000 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the predicted interval dates. The daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was lower than the one projected for all SSA countries. The case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 infection in SSA was 3.42%. Among the 44 SSA countries for which the correlation could be estimated, it was negative for 17 (38.6 %) of them.Conclusions The natural characteristics of SSA and the public health measures implemented might partly explain that the actual data were lower than the predictions on the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA, but the low case ascertainment and the numerous asymptomatic cases did significantly influence this observation.Competing Interest StatementI have read the journal?s policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: Simeon Pierre Choukem who is co-author of this paper is also an Academic Editor for PLOS ONE journal.

%X Importance The SARS-CoV-2 non-spike structural proteins of nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) are critical in the host cell interferon response and memory T-cell immunity and have been grossly overlooked in the development of COVID vaccines.Objective To determine the safety and immunogenicity of UB-612, a multitope vaccine containing S1-RBD-sFc protein and rationally-designed promiscuous peptides representing sequence-conserved Th and CTL epitopes on the Sarbecovirus nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and spike (S2) proteins.Design, setting and participants UB-612 booster vaccination was conducted in Taiwan. A UB-612 booster dose was administered 6-8 months post-2nd dose in 1,478 vaccinees from 3,844 healthy participants (aged 18-85 years) who completed a prior placebo (saline)-controlled, randomized, observer-blind, multi-center Phase-2 primary 2-dose series (100-μg per dose; 28-day apart) of UB-612. The interim safety and immunogenicity were evaluated until 14 days post-booster.Exposure Vaccination with a booster 3rd-dose (100-μg) of UB-612 vaccine.Main outcomes and measures Solicited local and systemic AEs were recorded for seven days in the e-diaries of study participants, while skin allergic reactions were recorded for fourteen days. The primary immunogenicity endpoints included viral-neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT, Wuhan strain) and live Delta variant (VNT50), and against pseudovirus WT and Omicron variant (pVNT50). The secondary immunogenicity endpoints included anti-S1-RBD IgG antibody, S1-RBD:ACE2 binding inhibition, and T-cell responses by ELISpot and Intracellular Staining.Results No post-booster vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain and fatigue, mostly mild and transient. The UB-612 booster prompted a striking upsurge of neutralizing antibodies against live WT Wuhan strain (VNT50, 1,711) associated with unusually high cross-neutralization against Delta variant (VNT50, 1,282); and similarly with a strong effect against pseudovirus WT (pVNT50, 6,245) and Omicron variant (pVNT50, 1,196). Upon boosting, the lower VNT50 and pVNT50 titers of the elderly in the primary series were uplifted to the same levels as those of the young adults. The UB-612 also induced robust, durable VoC antigen-specific Th1-oriented (IFN-γ+-) responses along with CD8+ T-cell (CD107a+-Granzyme B+) cytotoxicity.Conclusions and relevance With a pronounced cross-reactive booster effect on B- and T-cell immunity, UB-612 may serve as a universal vaccine booster for comprehensive immunity enhancement against emergent VoCs.Trial registration [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04773067]Question Facing ever-emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants and long-haul COVID, can composition-updated new vaccines be constructed capable of inducing striking, durable booster-recalled B/T-immunity to prevent infection by VoCs?Findings In a Phase-2 extension study, a booster dose of UB-612 multitope protein-peptide vaccine prompted high viral-neutralizing titers against live wild-type virus (VNT50, 1,711), Delta variant (VNT50, 1,282); pseudovirus wild-type (pVNT50, 6,245) and Omicron variant (pVNT50, 1,196).

%X Background We studied whether comorbid conditions impact strength and duration of immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in a US-based, adult population.Methods Sera (pre-and-post-BNT162b2 vaccination) were tested serially up to 12 months after two doses of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2-anti-Spike neutralizing capacity by pseudotyping assay in 124 individuals; neutralizing titers were correlated to clinical variables with multivariate regression. Post-booster (third dose) effect was measured at 1 and 3 months in 72 and 88 subjects respectively.Results After completion of primary vaccine series, neutralizing antibody IC50 values were high at one month (14-fold increase from pre-vaccination), declined at six months (3.3-fold increase), and increased at one month post-booster (41.5-fold increase). Three months post-booster, IC50 decreased in COVID-naïve individuals (18-fold increase) and increased in prior COVID-19+ individuals (132-fold increase). Age &gt;65 years (β=-0.94, p=0.001) and malignancy (β=-0.88, p=0.002) reduced strength of response at 1 month. Both strength and durability of response at 6 months, respectively, were negatively impacted by end-stage renal disease [(β=-1.10, p=0.004); (β=-0.66, p=0.014)], diabetes mellitus [(β=-0.57, p=0.032); (β=-0.44, p=0.028)], and systemic steroid use [(β=-0.066, p=0.032); (β=-0.55, p=0.037)]. Post-booster IC50 was robust against WA-1 and B.1.617.2, but the immune response decreased with malignancy (β =-0.68, p=0.03) and increased with prior COVID-19 (p-value &lt; 0.0001).Conclusion Multiple clinical factors impact the strength and duration of neutralization response post-primary series vaccination, but not the post-booster dose strength. Prior COVID-19 infection enhances the booster-dose response except in individuals with malignancy, suggesting a need for clinically guiding vaccine dosing regimens.Summary Multiple clinical factors impact the strength and duration of neutralization response post-primary series vaccination. All subjects, irrespective of prior COVID infection, benefited from a third dose. Malignancy decreased response following third dose, suggesting the importance of clinically guided vaccine regimens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health (awards R01 AI150334 to RES).

%T SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics revealed by wastewater sequencing analysis and deconvolution

%X The use of RNA sequencing from wastewater samples is a valuable way for estimating infection dynamics and circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2. This approach is independent from testing individuals and can therefore become the key tool to monitor this and potentially other viruses. However, it is equally important to develop easily accessible and scalable tools which can highlight critical changes in infection rates and dynamics over time across different locations given sequencing data from wastewater. Here, we provide an analysis of lineage dynamics in Berlin and New York City using wastewater sequencing and present PiGx SARS-CoV-2, a highly reproducible computational analysis pipeline with comprehensive reports. This end-to-end pipeline includes all steps from raw data to shareable reports, additional taxonomic analysis, deconvolution and geospatial time series analyses. Using simulated datasets (in silico generated and spiked-in samples) we could demonstrate the accuracy of our pipeline calculating proportions of Variants of Concern (VOC) from environmental as well as pre-mixed samples (spiked-in). By applying our pipeline on a dataset of wastewater samples from Berlin between February 2021 and January 2022, we could reconstruct the emergence of B.1.1.7(alpha) in February/March 2021 and the replacement dynamics from B.1.617.2 (delta) to BA.1 and BA.2 (omicron) during the winter of 2021/2022. Using data from very-short-reads generated in an industrial scale setting, we could see even higher accuracy in our deconvolution. Lastly, using a targeted sequencing dataset from New York City (receptor-binding-domain (RBD) only), we could reproduce the results recovering the proportions of the so-called cryptic lineages shown in the original study. Overall our study provides an in-depth analysis reconstructing virus lineage dynamics from wastewater, and that our tool can be used to identify new mutations and to detect any emerging new lineages with different amplification and sequencing methods. Our approach can support efforts to establish continuous monitoring and early-warning projects for detecting SARS-CoV-2 or any other pathogen.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data is available openly, and not human data at all.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The rapid worldwide spread of the mildly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has led to the suggestion that it will induce levels of collective immunity that will help putting an end to the COVID19 pandemics.Methods Convalescent serums from non-hospitalized individuals previously infected with Alpha, Delta or Omicron BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 or subjected to a full mRNA vaccine regimen were evaluated for their ability to neutralize a broad panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants.Findings Prior vaccination or infection with the Alpha or to a lesser extent Delta strains conferred robust neutralizing titers against most variants, albeit more weakly against Beta and even more Omicron. In contrast, Omicron convalescent serums only displayed low level of neutralization activity against the cognate virus and were unable to neutralize other SARS-CoV-2 variants.Interpretation Moderately symptomatic Omicron infection is only poorly immunogenic and does not represent a substitute for vaccination.Funding EPFL COVID Fund; private foundation advised by CARIGEST SA; Private Foundation of the Geneva University Hospitals; General Directorate of Health of the canton of Geneva, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementEPFL COVID Fund; private foundation advised by CARIGEST SA; Private Foundation of the Geneva University Hospitals; General Directorate of Health of the canton of Geneva, the Swiss Federal Office of Public HealthAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Geneva Cantonal Commission for Research Ethics gave approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background People living with chronic disease, particularly seniors older than 60 years old, are lagging behind in the national vaccination campaign in China due to uncertainty of safety and effectiveness. However, this special population made up of most severe symptom and death cases among infected patients and should be prioritized in vaccination program. In this retrospective study, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the CoronaVac inactivated vaccines in people with underlying medical conditions to address the vaccine hesitation in this special population.Methods In this cohort study, volunteers aged 40 years and older, had received two doses of CoronaVac inactivated vaccines (3-5 weeks interval), been healthy or with at least one of the six diseases: coronary heart disease (CAD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic respiratory disease (CRD), obesity and cancer, were recruited from 4 study sites in China. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of adverse events within 14 days after each dose of vaccination. The primary immunogenic outcome was geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies to living SARS-CoV-2 virus at 14-28 days, 3 months, and 6 months after full two-dose vaccination. This study is registered with ChiCTR.org.cn (ChiCTR2200058281) and is active but no longer recruiting.Findings Among 1,302 volunteers screened between Jul 5 and Dec 30, 2021, 969 were eligible and enrolled in our cohort, including 740 living with underlying medical conditions and 229 as healthy control. All of them formed the safety cohort. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 150 (20.27%) of 740 in the comorbidities group versus 32 (13.97%) of 229 in the healthy group, with significant difference (P=0.0334). The difference was mainly contributed by fatigue and injection-site pain in some groups. Most adverse reactions were mild (Grade 1). We did not observe any serious adverse events related to vaccination. By day 14-28 post vaccination, the seroconversion rates and GMT of neutralizing antibody showed no significant difference between disease group and healthy group, except CAD group (P=0.03) and CRD group (P=0.04) showed slight reduction. By day 90, the neutralizing antibody GMTs were significantly reduced in each group, with no significant difference between diseases and healthy group. By day 180, the neutralizing antibody continued to decrease in each group, but with slower declination.Interpretation For people living with chronic disease especially seniors older than 60 years, the CoronaVac vaccines are as safe as in healthy people. Although the immunogenicity is slightly different in subgroup of some diseases compared with that of the healthy population, the overall trend was consistent. Our findings highlight the evidence to address vaccine hesitancy for seniors and people living with chronic diseases.Funding Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department (202102AA100051 and 202003AC100010, China), Sinovac Biotech Ltd (PRO-nCOV-4004).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department (202102AA100051 and 202003AC100010, China) and Sinovac Biotech Ltd (PRO-nCOV-4004).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The clinical trial protocol and informed consent form were approved by the Committee on Human Subject Research and Ethics of Yunnan University (CHSRE2021021).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant first emerged as the BA.1 sub-lineage, with extensive escape from neutralizing immunity elicited by previous infection with other variants, vaccines, or combinations of both1,2. Two new sub-lineages, BA.4 and BA.5, are now emerging in South Africa with changes relative to BA.1, including L452R and F486V mutations in the spike receptor binding domain. We isolated live BA.4 and BA.5 viruses and tested them against neutralizing immunity elicited to BA.1 infection in participants who were Omicron/BA.1 infected but unvaccinated (n=24) and participants vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2 or Johnson and Johnson Ad26.CoV.2S with breakthrough Omicron/BA.1 infection (n=15). In unvaccinated individuals, FRNT50, the inverse of the dilution for 50% neutralization, declined from 275 for BA.1 to 36 for BA.4 and 37 for BA.5, a 7.6 and 7.5-fold drop, respectively. In vaccinated BA.1 breakthroughs, FRNT50 declined from 507 for BA.1 to 158 for BA.4 (3.2-fold) and 198 for BA.5 (2.6-fold). Absolute BA.4 and BA.5 neutralization levels were about 5-fold higher in this group versus unvaccinated BA.1 infected participants. The observed escape of BA.4 and BA.5 from BA.1 elicited immunity is more moderate than of BA.1 against previous immunity1,3. However, the low absolute neutralization levels for BA.4 and BA.5, particularly in the unvaccinated group, are unlikely to protect well against symptomatic infection4.This may indicate that, based on neutralization escape, BA.4 and BA.5 have potential to result in a new infection wave.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates award INV-018944 (AS), National Institutes of Health award R01 AI138546 (AS), and South African Medical Research Council Award 6084COAP2020 (AS)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Blood samples were obtained after written informed consent from adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at the Africa Health Research Institute approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (reference BREC/00001275/2020).

%X Background Solid organ transplant recipients have attenuated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this study, we report on immune responses to 3rd- (V3) and 4th- (V4) doses of heterologous and homologous vaccines in a kidney transplant population.Methods 724 kidney transplant recipients were prospectively screened for serological responses following 3 primary doses of a SARS-CoV2 vaccine. 322 patients were sampled post-V4 for anti-spike (anti-S), with 69 undergoing assessment of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses. All vaccine doses were received post-transplant, only mRNA vaccines were used for V3 and V4 dosing. All participants had serological testing performed post-V2 and at least once prior to their 1st dose of vaccine.Results 586/724 (80.9%) patients were infection-naïve post-V3; 141/2586 (24.1%) remained seronegative at 31 (21-51) days post-V3. Timing of vaccination in relation to transplantation, OR: 0.28 (0.15-0.54), p=0.0001; immunosuppression burden, OR: 0.22 (0.13-0.37), p&lt;0.0001, and a diagnosis of diabetes, OR: 0.49 (0.32-0.75), p=0.001, remained independent risk factors for non-seroconversion. Seropositive patients post-V3 had greater anti-S if primed with BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1, p=0.001.Post-V4, 45/239 (18.8%) infection-naïve patients remained seronegative. De novo seroconversion post-V4 occurred in 15/60 (25.0%) patients who were seronegative post-V3. There was no difference in anti-S post-V4 by vaccine combination, p=0.50. Anti-S post-V4 were sequentially greater in those seroconverting post V2- compared with V3-, and V3- compared with V4-, at 1561 (567-5211), 379 (101-851) and 19 (9.7-48) BAU/ml respectively.T-cell responses were poor, with only 11/54 (20.4%) infection-naive patients having detectable T-cell responses post-V4, with no difference seen by vaccine type.Conclusion A significant proportion of transplant recipients remain seronegative following 3- and 4- doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with poor T-cell responses, and are likely to have inadequate protection against infection.Competing Interest StatementMW/PK have received study support for this work from Oxford Immunotec.Funding StatementThe study received support from The Nan Diamond FundAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Wales Research Ethics Committee 1 (Reference: 20/WA/0123) gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Determining accurate estimates for the characteristics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, by fitting mathematical models to data, is made difficult by the lack of measurements early in the infection. To determine the sensitivity of viral predictions to the noise in the data, we developed a novel two-patch within-host mathematical model and investigated its ability to match population level data. We proposed several approaches that can improve practical identifiability of parameters, including an optimal experimental approach, and found that availability of viral data early in the infection is of essence for improving the accuracy of the estimates. Our findings can be useful for designing interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSMC acknowledges support from National Science Foundation grants No. DMS-1813011 and DMS-2051820 and by a Virginia Tech Center for Emerging, Zoonotic, and Arthropod-borne Pathogens (CeZAP) seed grant.

%X Background The coronavirus 2019 omicron variant has surged rapidly and raises concerns about immune evasion because it harbors mutations even in individuals with complete vaccination. Here, we examine the capability of the booster vaccination to induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) and T-cell responses.Methods A total of 167 participants primed with heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 were enrolled to receive AZD1222, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 as a booster dose. Reactogenicity was recorded. Binding antibody, neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers against omicron BA.1 and BA.2, and total interferon gamma (IFN-γ) post-booster responses were measured.Results A substantial loss in neutralizing potency to omicron variant was found at 4 to 5 months after receiving the heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222. Following booster vaccination, a significant increase in binding antibodies and neutralizing activities toward delta and omicron variants was observed. Neutralization to omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were comparable, showing the highest titers after boosted mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2 and AZD1222. Notably, boosted individuals with mRNA vaccines could induce T cell response. Reactogenicity was mild to moderate without serious adverse events.Conclusions Our findings highlight that the booster vaccination could overcome immunity wanes and provide adequate NAbs coverage against omicron BA.1 and BA.2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialTCTR20211120002Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Research Council of Thailand, the Health Systems Research Institute, the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology of Chulalongkorn University, and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.

%X As SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, several variants of concern (VOCs) have arisen which are defined by multiple mutations in their spike proteins. These VOCs have shown variable escape from antibody responses, and have been shown to trigger qualitatively different antibody responses during infection. By studying plasma from individuals infected with either the original D614G, Beta or Delta variants, we show that the Beta and Delta variants elicit antibody responses that are overall more cross-reactive than those triggered by D614G. Patterns of cross-reactivity varied, and the Beta and Delta variants did not elicit cross-reactive responses to each other. However, Beta-elicited plasma was highly cross-reactive against Delta plus (Delta+) which differs from Delta by a single K417N mutation in the receptor binding domain, suggesting the plasma response targets the N417 residue. To probe this further, we isolated monoclonal antibodies from a Beta-infected individual with plasma responses against Beta, Delta+ and Omicron, which all possess the N417 residue. We isolated a N417-dependent antibody, 084-7D, which showed similar neutralization breadth to the plasma. The 084-7D mAb utilized the IGHV3-23*01 germline gene and had similar somatic hypermutations compared to previously described public antibodies which target the 417 residue. Thus, we have identified a novel antibody which targets a shared epitope found on three distinct VOCs, enabling their cross-neutralization. Understanding antibodies targetting escape mutations such as K417N, which repeatedly emerge through convergent evolution in SARS-CoV-2 variants, may aid in the development of next-generation antibody therapeutics and vaccines.Importance The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in variants of concern (VOCs) with distinct spike mutations conferring varying immune escape profiles. These variable mutations also influence the cross-reactivity of the antibody response mounted by individuals infected with each of these variants. This study sought to understand the antibody responses elicited by different SARS-CoV-2 variants, and to define shared epitopes. We show that Beta and Delta infection resulted in antibody responses that were more cross-reactive compared to the original D614G variant, but each with differing patterns of cross-reactivity. We further isolated an antibody from Beta infection, which targeted the N417 site, enabling cross-neutralization of Beta, Delta+ and Omicron, all of which possess this residue. The discovery of antibodies which target escape mutations common to multiple variants highlights conserved epitopes to target in future vaccines and therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementPLM is supported by the South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Innovation and National Research Foundation of South Africa.

%X Background After establishing safety and immunogenicity of Biological E’s CORBEVAX™ vaccine in adult population (18-80 years) in Phase 1-3 studies, vaccine is further tested in children and adolescents in this study.Methods This is a phase-2/3 prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, study evaluating safety, reactogenicity, tolerability and immunogenicity of CORBEVAX™ vaccine in children and adolescents of either gender between &lt;18 to ≥12 years of age in Phase-II and &lt;18 to ≥5 years of age in Phase-III with placebo as a control. This study has two age sub groups; age subgroup-1 with subjects &lt;18 to ≥12 years of age and age subgroup-2 with subjects &lt;12 to ≥5 years of age. In both age sub groups eligible subjects (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative and seronegative at baseline) were randomized to receive either CORBEVAX™ vaccine or Placebo in 3: 1 ratio.Findings The safety profile of CORBEVAX™ vaccine in both pediatric cohorts was comparable to the placebo control group. Majority of reported adverse events (AEs) were mild in nature. No severe or serious AEs, medically attended AEs (MAAEs) or AEs of special interest (AESI) were reported during the study period and all the reported AEs resolved without any sequelae. In both pediatric age groups, CORBEVAX™ vaccinated subjects showed significant improvement in humoral immune-responses in terms of anti-RBD-IgG concentrations, anti-RBD-IgG1 titers, neutralizing antibody (nAb)-titers against Ancestral Wuhan and Delta strains. Significantly high interferon gamma immune response (cellular) was elicited by CORBEVAX™ vaccinated subjects with minimal effect on IL-4 cytokine secretion.Interpretations The safety profile of CORBEVAX™ vaccine in &lt;18 to ≥5 years’ children and adolescents was found to be safe and tolerable. The adverse event profile was also found to be acceptable. Significant increase in anti-RBD IgG and nAb titers and IFN-gamma immune responses were observed post vaccination in both pediatric age sub groups. Both humoral and cellular immune responses were found to be non-inferior to the immune responses induced by CORBEVAX™ vaccine in adult population. This study shows that CORBEVAX™ vaccine is highly immunogenic and can be safely administered to pediatric population as young as 5 years old.The study was prospectively registered with clinical trial registry of India-CTRI/2021/10/037066Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialCTRI/2021/10/037066Funding StatementBIRAC- a division of the Department of Biotechnology, Govt of India provided partial funding for the execution of trials.

%X Background While dialysis patients are at greater risk of serious SARS-CoV-2 complications, stringent infection prevention measures can help mitigate the risk of infection and transmission within dialysis facilities. We describe an outbreak of 14 cases diagnosed in a 13-day period in the second quarter of 2021 in a hospital-based ESRD facility, and our coordinated use of epidemiology, viral genome sequencing, and infection control practices to quickly end the cycle of transmission.Methods Symptomatic patients and staff members were diagnosed via RT-PCR tests. Facility-wide screening was conducted using rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from residual diagnostic PCR specimens.Results Of the 106 patients who received dialysis in the facility, 10 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as was one patient support person. Of three positive staff members, two were unvaccinated and had provided care for six and four of the affected patients, respectively. Sequencing demonstrated that all the cases in the cluster shared an identical B.1.1.7./Alpha substrain. Attack rates were greatest among unvaccinated patients and staff. Vaccine effectiveness was 88% among patients.Conclusions Prompt recognition of an infection cluster and rapid intervention efforts successfully ended the outbreak. Alongside consistent adherence to core infection prevention measures, vaccination was highly effective in reducing disease incidence and morbidity in this vulnerable population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by an Emergent Ventures Fast Grant [grant number 2243] to PK and by the Gundersen Medical Foundation.

%X Background The Omicron variant has caused a new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide. We explore crucial epidemiological parameters driving seasonal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in secondary schools and assess various infection control interventions over a 2.5-year time frame.Methods We developed an agent-based model parameterised with data from secondary schools in the Netherlands. We modelled the circulation of Omicron assuming a stable introduction rate of infections and accounted for uncertainty in epidemiological parameters describing virus transmissibility, susceptibility to reinfection, vaccine immune escape, and waning of sterilising immunity. We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 health burden defined as number of symptomatic student days. We further evaluated the cost-benefit (number of prevented infected students per absent student) for reactive quarantine interventions, regular screening using antigen tests, and annual booster vaccinations.Findings Durability of sterilising immunity is a key parameter that governs temporal SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns in secondary schools. Our model predicts pronounced within-school seasonal patterns with dominant autumn outbreaks and smaller winter outbreaks and a maximum prevalence of 2.9% (95% CI: 0.7%-6.6%) symptomatic students during infection peaks. Regular screening and annual booster vaccination may reduce the health burden up to 15% (95% CI: 1.5%-27.8%) and have a higher cost-benefit ratio than reactive quarantine interventions (reduction: 4.3%; 95% CI: -10.1% to 17.6%).Interpretation Immunity waning will determine the intensity and pattern of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in secondary schools in the medium-term future. If mitigation strategies are needed, screening and annual booster vaccination have the highest cost-benefit by reducing viral transmission with little educational disruption.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementGR, IW, and PB were supported by the VERDI project (101045989), funded by the European Union.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data used in our study were collected as part of a national implementation programme executed by the ministry of education of the Netherlands.

%X Background COVID-19 has been a major public health threat for the past two years, with disproportionate effects on the elderly, immunocompromised, and pregnant women. While much has been done in delineating immune dysfunctions and pathogenesis in the former two groups, less is known about the disease’s progression in expectant women and children born to them. To address this knowledge gap, we profiled the immune responses in maternal and child sera as well as breast milk in terms of antibody and cytokine expression and performed histopathological studies on placentae obtained from mothers convalescent from antenatal COVID-19.Methods and findings A total of 17 mother-child dyads (8 cases of antenatal COVID-19 and 9 healthy unrelated controls; 34 individuals in total) were recruited to the Gestational Immunity For Transfer (GIFT) study. Maternal and infant sera, and breast milk samples were collected over the first year of life. All samples were analyzed for IgG and IgA against whole SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), and previously reported immunodominant epitopes, with conventional ELISA approaches. Cytokine levels were quantified in maternal sera using multiplex microbead-based Luminex arrays. The placentae were examined microscopically. We found high levels of virus-specific IgG in convalescent mothers and similarly elevated titers in newborn children. Virus-specific IgG in infant circulation waned within 3-6 months of life. Virus-specific IgA levels were variable among convalescent individuals’ sera and breast milk. Convalescent mothers also showed a blood cytokine signature indicative of a persistent pro-inflammatory state. Four placentae presented signs of acute inflammation marked by neutrophil infiltration even though &gt;50 days had elapsed between virus clearance and delivery. Administration of a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to mothers convalescent from antenatal COVID-19 increased virus-specific IgG and IgA titers in breast milk.Conclusions Antenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection led to high plasma titres of virus-specific antibodies in infants postnatally. However, this was not reflected in milk; milk-borne antibody levels varied widely. Additionally, placentae from COVID-19 positive mothers exhibited signs of acute inflammation with neutrophilic involvement, particularly in the subchorionic region. Virus neutralisation by plasma was not uniformly achieved, and the presence of antibodies targeting known immunodominant epitopes did not assure neutralisation. Antibody transfer ratios and the decay of transplacentally transferred virus-specific antibodies in neonatal circulation resembled that for other pathogens. Convalescent mothers showed signs of chronic inflammation marked by persistently elevated IL17RA levels in their blood. A single dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine provided significant boosts to milk-borne virus-specific antibodies, highlighting the importance of receiving the vaccine even after natural infection with the added benefit of enhanced passive immunity.

%X Patients suffering from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are at high risk for deadly secondary fungal infections such as COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) and COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). Despite this clinical observation, direct experimental evidence for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-driven alterations of antifungal immunity is scarce. Using an ex-vivo whole blood (WB) stimulation assay, we challenged blood from twelve COVID-19 patients with Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus antigens and studied the expression of activation, maturation, and exhaustion markers, as well as cytokine secretion. Compared to healthy controls, T-helper cells from COVID-19 patients displayed increased expression levels of the exhaustion marker PD-1 and weakened A. fumigatus- and R. arrhizus-induced activation. While baseline secretion of proinflammatory cytokines was massively elevated, WB from COVID-19 patients elicited diminished release of T-cellular (e.g., IFN-γ, IL-2) and innate immune cell-derived (e.g., CXCL9, CXCL10) cytokines in response to A. fumigatus and R. arrhizus antigens. Additionally, samples from COVID-19 patients showed deficient granulocyte activation by mold antigens and reduced fungal killing capacity of neutrophils. These features of weakened anti-mold immune responses were largely decoupled from COVID-19 severity, the time elapsed since diagnosis of COVID-19, and recent corticosteroid uptake, suggesting that impaired anti-mold defense is a common denominator of the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, these results expand our understanding of the immune predisposition to post-viral mold infections and could inform future studies of immunotherapeutic strategies to prevent and treat fungal superinfections in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a grant of the Stiftung zur Foerderung der Krebsforschung an der Universitaet Wuerzburg (Forschung hilft), grant allocation number 8607630 (to CDL and JL); Nachweis von Immunzellbotenstoffen gegen Covid-19 fuer die Diagnostik und Impfstofftestung.

%X Background Few studies have assessed the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines in settings where most of the population had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection.Methods We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 vaccine in Kenya from a societal perspective over a 1.5-year time frame. An age-structured transmission model assumed at least 80% of the population to have prior natural immunity when an immune escape variant was introduced. We examine the effect of slow (18 months) or rapid (6 months) vaccine roll-out with vaccine coverage of 30%, 50% or 70% of the adult (&gt; 18 years) population prioritizing roll-out in over 50-year olds (80% uptake in all scenarios). Cost data were obtained from primary analyses. We assumed vaccine procurement at $7 per dose and vaccine delivery costs of $3.90-$6.11 per dose. The cost-effectiveness threshold was USD 919.Findings Slow roll-out at 30% coverage largely targets over 50-year-olds and resulted in 54% fewer deaths (8,132(7,914 to 8,373)) than no vaccination and was cost-saving (ICER=US$-1,343 (-1,345 to - 1,341) per DALY averted). Increasing coverage to 50% and 70%, further reduced deaths by 12% (810 (757 to 872) and 5% (282 (251 to 317) but was not cost-effective, using Kenya’s cost-effectiveness threshold ($ 919.11). Rapid roll-out with 30% coverage averted 63% more deaths and was more cost-saving (ICER=$-1,607 (-1,609 to -1,604) per DALY averted) compared to slow roll-out at the same coverage level, but 50% and 70% coverage scenarios were not cost-effective.Interpretation With prior exposure partially protecting much of the Kenyan population, vaccination of young adults may no longer be cost-effective.What is already known?The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial number of cases and deaths in low-and middle-income countries.COVID-19 vaccines are considered the main strategy of curtailing the pandemic. However, many African nations are still at the early phase of vaccination.Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines are useful in estimating value for money and illustrate opportunity costs. However, there is a need to balance these economic outcomes against the potential impact of vaccination.What are the new findings?In Kenya, a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes those of an older age and is deployed at a rapid rollout speed achieves greater marginal health impacts and is better value for money.Given the existing high-level population protection to COVID-19 due to prior exposure, vaccination of younger adults is less cost-effective in Kenya.What do the new findings imply?Rapid deployment of vaccines during a pandemic averts more cases, hospitalisations, and deaths and is more cost-effective.Against a context of constrained fiscal space for health, it is likely more prudent for Kenya to target those at severe risk of disease and possibly other vulnerable populations rather than to the whole population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded International Decision Support Initiative (IDSI), and funding from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Global Health Research Unit on the Application of Genomics and Modelling to the Control of Virus Pathogens (17/63/82), on Mucosal Pathogens (16/136/46), and on Tackling Infections to Benefit Africa (16/136/33),using UK aid from the UK Government to support global health research, The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Wellcome Trust (grant# 220985/Z/20/Z).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a spectrum of clinical outcomes and diverse memory responses. Population studies indicate that viral neutralizing antibody responses are protective, but do not always develop post-infection. Other antiviral antibody effector functions, T-cell responses, or immunity to seasonal coronaviruses (OC43, 229E) have been implicated but not defined in all ages. Here, we identify that children and adult subjects generate polyfunctional antibodies to the spike protein after asymptomatic infection or mild disease, with some subjects developing cellular responses without seroconversion. Diversity in immunity was explained by two clusters distinguished by CD4+ T-cell cytokines, age, and antibodies to seasonal coronaviruses. Post-vaccination neutralizing responses were predicted by specific post-infection immune measures, including IL-2, spike-IgA, OC43-IgG1, 229E-IgM. We confirm a key role for CD4+ T cell cytokines in functionality of anti-spike antibodies, and show that antibody diversity is impacted by age, Th/Th2 cytokine biases, and antibody isotypes to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding for this study was provided under NIH Project U54CA260581-01.

%X It is uncertain to which extent antibody and T-cell responses after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are associated with reduced risk of breakthrough infection and whether their measurement enhances risk prediction. We conducted a phase-4 open-label clinical trial in the pre-omicron era, enrolling 2,760 individuals aged ≥16 years 35±8 days after having received the second dose of BNT162b2 (baseline 15-21 May 2021). Over a median 5.9-month of follow-up, we identified incident SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections using weekly antigen tests, a confirmatory PCR test, and/or serological evidence for incident infection. We quantified relative risks adjusted for age, sex, and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for different immunological parameters and assessed improvements in risk discrimination. In contrast to the T-cell response, higher plasma levels of binding antibodies and antibodies in a surrogate neutralization assay were associated with reduced risk of breakthrough infection. Furthermore, assessment of anti-spike IgG levels enhanced prediction of breakthrough infection and may therefore be a suitable measurable correlate of protection in practice.Competing Interest StatementDB declares to hold stocks of Pfizer.

%T Wastewater to clinical case (WC) ratio of COVID-19 identifies insufficient clinical testing, onset of new variants of concern and population immunity in urban communities

%X Clinical testing has been the cornerstone of public health monitoring and infection control efforts in communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With the extant and anticipated reduction of clinical testing as the disease moves into an endemic state, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance (WWS) is likely to have greater value as an important diagnostic tool to inform public health. As the widespread adoption of WWS is relatively new at the scale employed for COVID-19, interpretation of data, including the relationship to clinical cases, has yet to be standardized. An in-depth analysis of the metrics derived from WWS is required for public health units/agencies to interpret and utilize WWS-acquired data effectively and efficiently. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater signal to clinical cases (WC) ratio was investigated across seven different cities in Canada over periods ranging from 8 to 21 months. Significant increases in the WC ratio occurred when clinical testing eligibility was modified to appointment-only testing, identifying a period of insufficient clinical testing in these communities. The WC ratio decreased significantly during the emergence of the Alpha variant of concern (VOC) in a relatively non-immunized community’s wastewater (40-60% allelic proportion), while a more muted decrease in the WC ratio signaled the emergence of the Delta VOC in a relatively well-immunized community’s wastewater (40-60% allelic proportion). Finally, a rapid and significant decrease in the WC ratio signaled the emergence of the Omicron VOC, likely because of the variant’s greater effectiveness at evading immunity, leading to a significant number of new reported clinical cases, even when vaccine-induced community immunity was high. The WC ratio, used as an additional monitoring metric, complements clinical case counts and wastewater signals as individual metrics in its ability to identify important epidemiological occurrences, adding value to WWS as a diagnostic technology during the COVID-19 pandemic and likely for future pandemics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded and supported by Ontario's Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks SARS-CoV-2 surveillance initiative (awarded to the University of Ottawa, the University of Toronto, and the University of Waterloo), by CHEO (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario) CHAMO (Children's Hospital Academic Medical Organization) (awarded to Dr. Alex E.

%X Due to the recrudescence of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide, mainly caused by Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants of concern, several jurisdictions are administering a mRNA vaccine boost. Here, we analyzed humoral responses induced after the second and third doses of mRNA vaccine in naïve and previously-infected donors who received their second dose with an extended 16-week interval. We observed that the extended interval elicited robust humoral responses against VOCs, but this response was significantly diminished 4 months after the second dose. Administering a boost to these individuals brought back the humoral responses to the same levels obtained after the extended second dose. Interestingly, we observed that administering a boost to individuals that initially received a short 3-4 weeks regimen elicited humoral responses similar to those elicited in the long interval regimen. Nevertheless, humoral responses elicited by the boost in naïve individuals did not reach those present in previously-infected vaccinated individuals.Competing Interest StatementA.R.G. is a consultant for Relation Therapeutics.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses a great threat to global health, particularly in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Although a 3-dose mRNA vaccination protocol has been implemented for the majority of SOTRs, its effectiveness was still largely unknown. We analyzed 113 vaccinated SOTRs, and 30 healthy controls (HCs), some of whom had recovered from COVID, for their immune responses against the original vaccine strain and variants of concern (VOC), including the highly mutated-omicron variant. Here, we report that 3 doses of the mRNA vaccine had only a modest effect in eliciting anti-viral responses against all viral strains in the fully vaccinated SOTRs who did not contract the virus. Only 34.0% (16/47) of this group of patients demonstrated both detectable anti-RBD IgG and neutralization activities against alpha, beta, and delta variants, and only 8.5% (4/47) of them showed additional omicron-neutralizing capacities. In contrast, 79.5% (35/44) of the vaccinated recovered-SOTRs demonstrated both higher anti-RBD IgG levels and neutralizing activities against all VOC, including omicron. These findings illustrate a significant impact of previous infection on the development of anti-COVID immune responses in vaccinated SOTRs and highlight the need for alternative strategies to protect a subset of a lesser-vaccine responsive population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work was supported by intramural research programs of Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia UniversityAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This retrospective study was approved by a protocol (AAAT3602) from Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

%X T cells play a pivotal role in reducing disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection and formation of long-term immune memory. We studied 50 COVID-19 convalescent patients and found that T cell response was induced more frequently and persisted longer than circulating antibodies. To identify epitopes that give rise to long-lived T cell memory, we performed ex vivo T cell expansion, MHC-tetramer cell-sorting, and high-throughput sequencing. We identified 756 clonotypes specific to nine known CD8+ T cell receptor (TCR) epitopes. Some epitopes were recognized by highly similar public clonotypes with restricted variable and joining segment usage. Receptors for other epitopes were extremely diverse, suggesting alternative modes of recognition. We also tracked persistence of epitope-specific response and individual clonotypes for a median of eight months after infection. The number of recognized epitopes per patient and quantity of epitope-specific clonotypes decreased over time, but the studied epitopes were characterized by uneven decline in the number of specific T cells. Epitopes with more clonally diverse TCR repertoires induced more pronounced and durable responses. In contrast, the abundance of specific clonotypes in peripheral circulation had no influence on their persistence. Our study demonstrates the durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ memory, and offers important implications for vaccine design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation grant 20-15-00395 (G.A.E.).

%X Background Breakthrough infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) has occurred in populations with high vaccination rates. These infections are due to sequence variation in the spike protein leading to a reduction in protection afforded by the current vaccines, which are based on the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, or by natural infection with pre-Omicron strains.Methods In a longitudinal cohort study, pre-breakthrough infection sera for Omicron breakthroughs (n=12) were analyzed. Assays utilized include a laboratory-developed solid phase binding assay to recombinant spike protein, a commercial assay to the S1 domain of the spike protein calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, and a commercial solid-phase surrogate neutralizing activity (SNA) assay. All assays employed spike protein preparations based on sequences from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Participant demographics and clinical characteristics were captured.Results Pre-breakthrough binding antibody (bAB) titers ranged from 1:800-1:51,200 for the laboratory-developed binding assay, which correlated well and agreed quantitatively with the commercial spike S1 domain WHO calibrated assay. SNA was detected in 10/12 (83%) samples.Conclusions Neither high bAB nor SNA were markers of protection from Omicron infection/re-infection. Laboratory tests with antigen targets based on Wuhan-Hu-1 may not accurately reflect the degree of immune protection from variants with significant spike protein differences. Omicron breakthrough infections are likely due to high sequence variation of the spike protein and reflect incomplete immune protection from previous infection with strains that preceded Omicron or with vaccinations based on the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays (U.S. Provisional Application Numbers: 62/994,252, 63/018,457, 63/020,503 and 63/024,436) and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (U.S. Provisional Application Number: 63/251,020) which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%X Saliva is easily obtainable non-invasively and potentially suitable for detecting both current and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We established 6 standardised enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) capable of detecting IgA and IgG antibodies to whole SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, to its receptor binding domain region and to nucleocapsid protein in saliva. In test accuracy (n=320), we found that spike IgG performed best (ROC AUC: 95.0%, 92.8-97.3%), followed by spike IgA (ROC AUC: 89.9%, 86.5-93.2%) for discriminating between pre-pandemic and post COVID-19 saliva samples. Using machine learning, diagnostic performance was improved when a combination of tests was used. As expected, salivary IgA was poorly correlated with serum, indicating an oral mucosal response whereas salivary IgG responses were predictive of those in serum. When deployed to 20 household outbreaks undergoing Delta and Omicron infection, antibody responses were heterogeneous but remained a reliable indicator of recent infection. Intriguingly, unvaccinated children showed evidence of exposure almost exclusively through specific IgA responses in the absence of evidence of viral infection. We have provided robust standardisation, evaluation, and field-testing of salivary antibody assays as tools for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. Future work should focus on investigating salivary antibody responses following infection and vaccination to understand patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and inform ongoing vaccination strategies.Competing Interest StatementAF is a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the UK national immunisation technical advisory group and is chair of the WHO European regional technical advisory group of experts (ETAGE)on immunisation and ex officio a member of the WHO SAGE working group on COVID vaccines.

%T Disease profile and plasma neutralizing activity of post-vaccination Omicron BA.1 infection in Tianjin, China: a retrospective study

%X Background SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant BA.1 first emerged on the Chinese mainland in January 2022 in Tianjin and caused a large wave of infections. During mass PCR testing, a total of 430 cases infected with Omicron were recorded between January 8 and February 7, 2022, with no new infections detected for the following 16 days. Most patients had been vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines. The disease profile associated with BA.1 infection, especially after vaccination with inactivated vaccines, is unclear. Whether BA.1 breakthrough infection after receiving inactivated vaccine could create a strong enough humoral immunity barrier against Omicron is not yet investigated.Methods We collected the clinical information and vaccination history of the 430 COVID-19 patients infected with Omicron BA.1. Re-positive cases and inflammation markers were monitored during the patient’s convalescence phase. Ordered multiclass logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity. Authentic virus neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 wildtype, Beta and Omicron BA.1 were conducted to examine the plasma neutralizing titers induced after post-vaccination Omicron BA.1 infection, and were compared to a group of uninfected healthy individuals who were selected to have a matched vaccination profile.Findings Among the 430 patients, 316 (73.5%) were adults with a median age of 47 years, and 114 (26.5%) were under-age with a median age of 10 years. Female and male patients account for 55.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Most of the patients presented with mild (47.7%) to moderate diseases (50.2%), with only 2 severe cases (0.5%) and 7 (1.6%) asymptomatic infections. No death was recorded. 341 (79.3%) of the 430 patients received inactivated vaccines (54.3% BBIBP-CorV vs. 45.5% CoronaVac), 49 (11.4%) received adenovirus-vectored vaccines (Ad5-nCoV), 2 (0.5%) received recombinant protein subunit vaccines (ZF2001), and 38 (8.8%) received no vaccination. No vaccination is associated with a substantially higher ICU admission rate among Omicron BA.1 infected patients (2.0% for vaccinated patients vs. 23.7% for unvaccinated patients, P&lt;0.001). Compared with adults, child patients presented with less severe illness (82.5% mild cases for children vs. 35.1% for adults, P&lt;0.001), no ICU admission, fewer comorbidities (3.5% vs. 53.2%, P&lt;0.001), and less chance of turning re-positive on nucleic acid tests (12.3% vs. 22.5%, P=0.019). For adult patients, compared with no prior vaccination, receiving 3 doses of inactivated vaccine was associated with significantly lower risk of severe disease (OR 0.227 [0.065-0.787], P=0.020), less ICU admission (OR 0.023 [0.002-0.214], P=0.001), lower re-positive rate on PCR (OR 0.240 [0.098-0.587], P=0.002), and shorter duration of hospitalization and recovery (OR 0.233 [0.091-0.596], P=0.002). At the beginning of the convalescence phase, patients who had received 3 doses of inactivated vaccine had substantially lower systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and C-reactive protein than unvaccinated patients, while CD4+/CD8+ ratio, activated Treg cells and Th1/Th2 ratio were higher compared to their 2-dose counterparts, suggesting that receipt of 3 doses of inactivated vaccine could step up inflammation resolution after infection. Plasma neutralization titers against Omicron, Beta, and wildtype significantly increased after breakthrough infection with Omicron. Moderate symptoms were associated with higher plasma neutralization titers than mild symptoms. However, vaccination profiles prior to infection, whether 2 doses versus 3 doses or types of vaccines, had no significant effect on post-infection neutralization titer. Among recipients of 3 doses of CoronaVac, infection with Omicron BA.1 largely increased neutralization titers against Omicron BA.1 (8.7x), Beta (4.5x), and wildtype (2.2x), compared with uninfected healthy individuals who have a matched vaccination profile.Interpretation Receipt of 3-dose inactivated vaccines can substantially reduce the disease severity of Omicron BA.1 infection, with most vaccinated patients presenting with mild to moderate illness. Child patients present with less severe disease than adult patients after infection. Omicron BA.1 convalescents who had received inactivated vaccines showed significantly increased plasma neutralizing antibody titers against Omicron BA.1, Beta, and wildtype SARS-CoV-2 compared with vaccinated healthy individuals.Funding This research is supported by Changping Laboratory (CPL-1233) and the Emergency Key Program of Guangzhou Laboratory (EKPG21-30-3), sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China.Evidence before this study Previous studies (many of which have not been peer-reviewed) have reported inconsistent findings regarding the effect of inactivated vaccines against the Omicron variant. On Mar 6, 2022, we searched PubMed with the query “(SARS-CoV-2) AND ((Neutralisation) OR (Neutralisation)) AND ((Omicron) OR (BA.1)) AND (inactivated vaccine)”, without date or language restrictions. This search identified 18 articles, of which 13 were directly relevant.Notably, the participants in many of these studies have received only one or two doses of inactivated vaccine with heterologous booster vaccination; other studies have a limited number of participants receiving inactivated vaccines.Added value of this study To date, this is the first study to report on the protective effect of inactivated vaccines against the severe disease caused by the Omicron variant. We examine and compare the disease profile of adults and children. Furthermore, we estimate the effect of post-vaccination omicron infection on plasma neutralization titers against Omicron and other SARS-COV-2 variants. Specifically, the disease profile of Omicron convalescents who had received two-dose primary series of inactivated vaccines with or without a booster dose prior to infection is compared with unvaccinated patients. We also analyzed the effect of infection on neutralizing activity by comparing vaccinated convalescents with vaccinated healthy individuals with matched vaccination profiles.Implications of all the available evidence Compared with adults, child patients infected with Omicron tend to present with less severe disease and are less likely to turn re-positive on nucleic acid tests. Receipt of two-dose primary series or three doses of inactivated vaccine is a protective factor against severe disease, ICU admission, re-positive PCR and longer hospitalization. The protection afforded by a booster dose is stronger than two-dose primary series alone. Besides vaccination, infection with Omicron is also a key factor for elevated neutralizing antibody titers, enabling cross-neutralization against Omicron, wildtype (WT) and the Beta variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research is supported by Changping Laboratory (CPL-1233) and the Emergency Key Program of Guangzhou Laboratory (EKPG21-30-3), sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the Tianjin Municipal Health Commission and the Ethics Committee of Tianjin First Central Hospital (2022N045KY).

%X Plasma samples taken at different time points from donors who received either AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) or Pfizer (Comirnaty) or Moderna (Spikevax) coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccine were assessed in virus neutralization assays against Delta and Omicron variants of concern and a reference isolate (VIC31). With the Pfizer vaccine there was 6-8-fold reduction in 50% neutralizing antibody titres (NT50) against Delta and VIC31 at 6 months compared to 2 weeks after the second dose; followed by 25-fold increase at 2 weeks after the third dose. Neutralisation of Omicron was only consistently observed 2 weeks after the third dose, with most samples having titres below the limit of detection at earlier timepoints. Moderna results were similar to Pfizer at 2 weeks after the second dose, while the titres for AstraZeneca samples derived from older donors were 7-fold lower against VIC31 and below the limit of detection against Delta and Omicron. Age and gender were not found to significantly impact our results. These findings indicate that vaccine matching may be needed, and that at least a third dose of these vaccines is necessary to generate sufficient neutralising antibodies against emerging variants of concern, especially Omicron, amidst the challenges of ensuring vaccine equity worldwide.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by funding (Principal Investigator: S.S.V.) from the CSIRO Precision Health &amp; Responsible Innovation Future Science Platforms, National Health and Medical Research Council (grant MRF2009092), and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Medical Countermeasures Initiative (contract 75F40121C00144).

%X Omicron (B.1.1.529) shows extensive escape from vaccine immunity, although vaccination reduces severe disease and death1. Boosting with vaccines incorporating variant spike sequences could possibly broaden immunity2. One approach to choose the variant may be to measure immunity elicited by vaccination combined with variant infection. Here we investigated Omicron neutralization in people infected with the Beta (B.1.351) variant and subsequently vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2. We observed that Beta infection alone elicited poor Omicron cross-neutralization, similar to what we previously found3 with BNT162b2 vaccination alone or in combination with ancestral or Delta virus infection. In contrast, Beta infection combined with BNT162b2 vaccination elicited neutralization with substantially lower Omicron escape.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates award INV-018944 (AS), National Institutes of Health award R01 AI138546 (AS), and South African Medical Research Council award 6084COAP2020 (AS).

%X Hong Kong reported 12,631 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 213 deaths in the first two years of the pandemic but experienced a major wave predominantly of Omicron BA.2.2 in early 2022 with over 1.1 million reported SARS-CoV-2 infections and more than 7900 deaths. Our data indicated a shorter incubation period, serial interval, and generation time of infections with Omicron than other SARS-CoV-2 variants.

%X Background There are presently conflicting data about level and duration of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in children after symptomatic or asymptomatic infection.Methods We enrolled adults and children in a prospective 6-month study in the following categories: 1) symptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ (SP+; children, n=8; adults, n=16), 2) symptomatic, PCR- or untested (children, n=27), 3) asymptomatic exposed (children, n=13) and 4) asymptomatic, no known exposure (children, n=19). Neutralizing and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and Spike protein variants were measured by multiplex serological assays.Results All SP+ children developed nAb, whereas 81% of SP+ adults developed nAb. Decline in the presence of nAb over 6 months was not significant in symptomatic children (100% to 87.5%, p=0.32) in contrast to adults (81.3 to 50.0%, p=0.03). Among all children with nAb (n=22), nAb titers and change in titers over 6 months were similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic children. Levels of IgG antibodies in children to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, RBD-1 and -2, nucleocapsid and N-terminal domain antigens and to Spike protein variants were similar to those in adults. IgG levels to primary antigens decreased over time in both children and adults, but levels to three of six Spike variants decreased only in children.Conclusions Children with asymptomatic or symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection develop robust neutralizing antibodies that remain present longer than in adults but wane in titer over time, and broad IgG antibodies that also wane in level over time.Key Points Children have robust neutralizing and IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection after symptomatic or asymptomatic disease that are at least as strong as in adults. Neutralizing antibodies in children last longer than in adults but wane over time.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Riley Childrens Foundation and the Indiana University School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval was granted by the Human Subjects and Institutional Review Board of Indiana University.

%X We propose a parsimonious, yet effective, susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-type model that incorporates the time change in the transmission and death rates. The model is calibrated by Tikhonov-type regularization from official reports from New York City (NYC), Chicago, the State of São Paulo, in Brazil, and British Columbia, in Canada. To forecast, we propose different ways to extend the transmission parameter, considering its estimated values. The forecast accuracy is then evaluated using real data from the above referred places. All the techniques accurately provided forecast scenarios for periods 15 days long. One of the models effectively predicted the magnitude of the four waves of infections in NYC, including the one caused by the Omicron variant for periods of 45 days long using out-of-sample data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by the Fundação Butantan {grant number 01/2020], Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Estado de Santa Catarina [grant number 00002847/2021], Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [grant numbers E-26/202.932/2019, E-26/202.933/2019, and E-26/202.927/2017], Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) [grant numbers 305544/2011-0 and 307873/2013-7], and Khalifa University [grant number FSU-2020-09].Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All the datasets used in this study were publicly available.

%X The rapid spread of the vaccine-resistant Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 presents a renewed threat to both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals, and accelerated booster vaccination campaigns are underway to mitigate the ongoing wave of Omicron cases. The degree of immunity provided by standard vaccine regimens, boosted regimens, and immune responses elicited by the combination of vaccination and natural infection remain incompletely understood. The relative magnitude, quality and durability of serological responses, and the likelihood of neutralizing protection against future SARS-CoV-2 variants following these modes of exposure are unknown but are critical to the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study of 99 vaccinated adults, we find that compared with responses after two doses of an mRNA regimen, the immune responses three months after a third vaccine dose and one month after breakthrough infection due to prior variants show dramatic increases in magnitude, potency, and breadth, including increased antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis and robust neutralization of the recently circulating Omicron variant. These results suggest that as the number of Omicron cases rise and as global vaccination and booster campaigns continue, an increasing proportion of the world’s population will acquire potent immune responses that may be protective against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by a grant from the M.

%X The B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant has rapidly supplanted most other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using microfluidics-based antibody affinity profiling (MAAP), we have recently shown that current therapeutic monoclonal antibodies exhibit a drastic loss of affinity against omicron. Here, we have characterized affinity and IgG concentration in the plasma of 39 individuals with multiple trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination as well as in 2 subjects without vaccination or infection. Antibody affinity in patient plasma samples was similar against the wild-type, delta, and omicron variants (KA ranges: 122±155, 159±148, 211±307 μM-1, respectively), indicating a surprisingly broad and mature cross-clade immune response. We then determined the antibody iso- and subtypes against multiple SARS-CoV-2 spike domains and nucleoprotein. Postinfectious and vaccinated subjects showed different profiles, with IgG3 (p = 0.002) but not IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 subtypes against the spike ectodomain being more prominent in the former group. Lastly, we found that the ELISA titers against the wildtype, delta, and omicron RBD variants correlated linearly with measured IgG concentrations (R=0.72) but not with affinity (R=0.29). These findings suggest that the wild-type and delta spike proteins induce a polyclonal immune response capable of binding the omicron spike with similar affinity. Changes in titers were primarily driven by antibody concentration, suggesting that B-cell expansion, rather than affinity maturation, dominated the response after infection or vaccination.Competing Interest StatementTPJK is a member of the board of directors of Fluidic Analytics.

%X The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and an ongoing global pandemic. Despite the development of vaccines, which protect healthy people from severe and life-threatening COVID-19, the immunological responses of people with secondary immunodeficiencies to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are currently not well understood. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), targets CD4+ T helper (Th) cells that orchestrate the immune response. Anti-retroviral therapy suppresses HIV burden and restores Th cell numbers. Here, we investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses elicited by the BTN162b2 vaccine in a cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH), who receive anti-retroviral therapy. While antibody responses in PLWH increased progressively after the first and second vaccination compared to baseline, they were reduced compared to HIV negative study participants (controls). CD8+ T cells exhibited a general activated phenotype and increased effector and effector memory compartments. In contrast, CD4+ Th cell responses exhibited a vaccination-dependent increase and were comparable between PLWH and controls. In line with their reduced humoral response, the correlation between neutralizing antibodies and the CD4+ T cell response was decreased in PLWH compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, CD4+ T cell activation negatively correlated with the CD4 to CD8 ratio, indicating that low CD4 T cell numbers do not necessarily interfere with cellular immune responses. Taken together, our data demonstrate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in PLWH results in potent cellular immune responses, but the reduced antibody responses suggest that booster vaccination might be required for preventing disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research received no external funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was authorized by the local ethics committee of the Ruhr-University Bochum (21-7351 and 20-6953-bio).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The influence of pre-existing humoral immunity, inter-individual demographic factors, and vaccine-associated reactogenicity on immunogenicity following COVID vaccination remains poorly understood.Methods Ten-fold cross-validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate symptoms experienced during natural infection and following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination along with demographics as predictors for antibody (AB) responses in COVID+ participants in a longitudinal cohort study.Results In previously infected individuals, AB were more durable and robust following vaccination when compared to natural infection alone. Higher AB were associated with experiencing dyspnea during natural infection, as was the total number of symptoms reported during the COVID-19 disease course. Both local and systemic symptoms following 1st and 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were predictive of higher AB after vaccination, as were the demographic factors of age and Hispanic ethnicity. Lastly, there was a significant temporal relationship between AB and days since infection or vaccination.Conclusion Vaccination in COVID+ individuals ensures a more robust immune response. Experiencing systemic and local symptoms post-vaccine is suggestive of higher AB, which may confer greater protection. Age and Hispanic ethnicity are predictive of higher AB.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays (U.S. Provisional Application Numbers: 62/994,252, 63/018,457, 63/020,503 and 63/024,436) and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (U.S. Provisional Application Number: 63/251,020) which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%X Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, new variants have continuously emerged and spread in populations. Among these, variants of concern (VOC) have been the main culprits of successive epidemic waves, due to their transmissibility, pathogenicity or ability to escape the immune response. Quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in raw wastewater is a reliable approach well-described and widely deployed worldwide to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human populations connected to sewage systems. Discrimination of VOCs in wastewater is also a major issue and can be achieved by genome sequencing or by detection of specific mutations suggesting the presence of VOCs. This study aimed to date the emergence of these VOCs (from Alpha to Omicron BA.2) by monitoring wastewater from the greater Paris area, France, but also to model the propagation dynamics of these VOCs and to characterize the replacement kinetics of the majority populations. These dynamics were compared to various individual-centered public health data, such as regional incidence and proportions of VOCs identified by sequencing of isolated patient strains. The viral dynamics in wastewater highlighted the impact of the vaccination strategy on the viral circulation in human populations but also suggested its potential effect on the selection of variants most likely to be propagated in immunized populations. Normalization of concentrations to capture population movements appeared statistically more reliable using variations in local drinking water consumption rather than using PMMoV concentrations because PMMoV fecal shedding was subject to variability and was not sufficiently relevant in this study. The dynamics of viral spread was observed earlier (about 13 days on the wave related to Omicron VOC) in raw wastewater than the regional incidence alerting to a possible risk of decorrelation between incidence and actual virus circulation probably resulting from a lower severity of infection in vaccinated populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funding by grants from french ministry of research end french ministry of healthAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In late 2019 SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to become a global pandemic, therefore, measures to attenuate chains of infection, such as high-throughput screenings and isolation of carriers were taken. Prerequisite for a reasonable and democratic implementation of such measures, however, is the availability of sufficient testing opportunities (beyond reverse transcription PCR, the current gold standard). We, therefore, propose an electrochemical, microfluidic multiplexed biosensor in combination with CRISPR/Cas-powered assays for point-of-care nucleic acid testing. In this study, we simultaneously screen for and identify SARS-CoV-2 infections (Omicron-variant) in clinical specimens (Sample-to-result time: ∼30 min), employing LbuCas13a, whilst bypassing reverse transcription as well as target amplification of the viral RNA, both of which are necessary for detection via PCR and multiple other methods. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of combining assays based on different classes of biomolecules, in this case protein-based antibiotic detection, on the same device. The programmability of the effector and multiplexing capacity (up to six analytes) of our platform, in combination with a miniaturized measurement setup, including a credit card sized near field communication (NFC) potentiostat and a microperistaltic pump, provide a promising on-site tool for identifying individuals infected with variants of concern and monitoring their disease progression alongside other potential biomarkers or medication clearance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) and Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF, Federal Ministry of Education and Research) under grant numbers 404478562, 421356369, 390939984 (EXC 2189 - CIBSS), and 13GW0493 (MERGE).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of University of Freiburg waived ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X HIV infection has been identified as one of the major risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease, but the mechanisms underpinning this susceptability are still unclear. Here, we assessed the impact of HIV infection on the quality and epitope specificity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in the first wave and second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. Flow cytometry was used to measure T cell responses following PBMC stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. Culture expansion was used to determine T cell immunodominance hierarchies and to assess potential SARS-CoV-2 escape from T cell recognition. HIV-seronegative individuals had significantly greater CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against the Spike protein compared to the viremic PLWH. Absolute CD4 count correlated positively with SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses (CD4 r= 0.5, p=0.03; CD8 r=0.5, p=0.001), whereas T cell activation was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell responses (CD4 r= −0.7, p=0.04). There was diminished T cell cross-recognition between the two waves, which was more pronounced in individuals with unsuppressed HIV infection. Importantly, we identify four mutations in the Beta variant that resulted in abrogation of T cell recognition. Together, we show that unsuppressed HIV infection markedly impairs T cell responses to SARS-Cov-2 infection and diminishes T cell cross-recognition. These findings may partly explain the increased susceptibility of PLWH to severe COVID-19 and also highlights their vulnerability to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.One sentence summary Unsuppressed HIV infection is associated with muted SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses and poorer recognition of the Beta variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by; HHMI International research scholar award (Grant #55008743 to ZMN).

%T Long- and short-term effects of cross-immunity in epidemic dynamics

%X The vertebrate immune system is capable of strong, focused adaptive responses that depend on T-cell specificity in recognizing antigenic sequences of a pathogen. Recognition tolerance and antigenic convergence cause cross-immune reactions that extend prompt, specific responses to rather similar pathogens. This suggests that reaching herd-immunity might be facilitated during successive epidemic outbreaks (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 waves with different variants). Qualitative studies play down this possibility because cross-immune protection is seldom sterilizing. We use minimal quantitative models to study how cross-immunity affects epidemic dynamics over short and long timescales. In the short scale, we investigate models of sterilizing and attenuating immunity, finding equivalences between both mechanisms—thus suggesting a key role of attenuating protection in achieving herd immunity. Our models render maps in epidemic-parameter space that discern threatening variants depending on acquired cross-immunity levels. We illustrate this application with SARS-CoV-2 data, including protection due to vaccination rates across countries. In the long-time scale, we model sterilizing cross-immunity between rolling pathogens to characterize statistical properties of successful strains. We find that sustained cross-immune protection alters the regions of epidemic-parameter space where large outbreaks happen. Our results suggest an optimistic revision concerning prospects for herd protection based on cross-immunity, including for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementBoth IA-D and LFS were supported by grant PID2020-113284GB-C21, funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033.

%X Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a strategy to identify, locate, and manage outbreaks of COVID19, and thereby possibly prevent surges in cases, which overwhelm local to global health care networks. The WBE process is based on assaying municipal wastewater for molecular markers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The standard process for sampling municipal wastewater is both time-consuming and requires the handling of large quantities of wastewater, which negatively affect throughput and timely reporting, and can increase safety risks. We report on a method to assay multiple sub-samples of a bulk wastewater sample. We document the effectiveness of this new approach by way of comparison of technologies for automating RNA purification from wastewater samples. We compared processes using the Perkin-Elmer Chemagic™ 360 to a PEG/NaCl/Qiagen protocol that is used for detection of N1 and N2 SARS-CoV-2 markers by the majority of 19 pandemic wastewater testing labs in the State of Michigan. Specifically, we found that the Chemagic™ 360 lowered handling time, decreased the amount of wastewater required by 10-fold, increased the amount of RNA isolated per µl of final elution product by approximately five-fold, and had no deleterious effect on subsequent ddPCR analysis. Moreover, for detection of markers on the borderline of detectability, we found that use of the Chemagic™ 360 enabled the detection of viral markers in a significant number of samples for which the result with the PEG/NaCl/Qiagen method was below the level of detectability. This improvement in detectability of the viral markers might be particularly important for early warning to public health authorities at the beginning of an outbreak.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Project AY of the WSU-MDHHS Master contract MA-2021, entitled "SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology: Wastewater Evaluation and Reporting (SEWER) Network" (Principal Investigators: Jeffrey L.

%X Background In January 2022, United States guidelines shifted to recommend isolation for 5 days from symptom onset, followed by 5 days of mask wearing. However, viral dynamics and variant and vaccination impact on culture conversion are largely unknown.Methods We conducted a longitudinal study on a university campus, collecting daily anterior nasal swabs for at least 10 days for RT-PCR and culture, with antigen rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) on a subset. We compared culture positivity beyond day 5, time to culture conversion, and cycle threshold trend when calculated from diagnostic test, from symptom onset, by SARS-CoV-2 variant, and by vaccination status. We evaluated sensitivity and specificity of RDT on days 4-6 compared to culture.Results Among 92 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive participants, all completed the initial vaccine series, 17 (18.5%) were infected with Delta and 75 (81.5%) with Omicron. Seventeen percent of participants had positive cultures beyond day 5 from symptom onset with the latest on day 12. There was no difference in time to culture conversion by variant or vaccination status. For the 14 sub-study participants, sensitivity and specificity of RDT were 100% and 86% respectively.Conclusions The majority of our Delta- and Omicron-infected cohort culture-converted by day 6, with no further impact of booster vaccination on sterilization or cycle threshold decay. We found that rapid antigen testing may provide reassurance of lack of infectiousness, though masking for a full 10 days is necessary to prevent transmission from the 17% of individuals who remain culture positive after isolation.Main Point Beyond day 5, 17% of our Delta and Omicron-infected cohort were culture positive. We saw no significant impact of booster vaccination on within-host Omicron viral dynamics. Additionally, we found that rapid antigen testing may provide reassurance of lack of infectiousness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness (MassCPR) and Boston University.

%X Despite the development of safe and effective vaccines, effective treatments for COVID-19 disease are still urgently needed. Several antiviral drugs have shown to be effective in reducing progression of COVID-19 disease. In the present work, we use an agent-based mathematical model to assess the potential population impact of the use of antiviral treatments in four countries with different demographic structure and current levels of vaccination coverage: Kenya, Mexico, United States (US) and Belgium. We analyzed antiviral effects on reducing hospitalization and death, and potential antiviral effects on reducing transmission. For each country, we varied daily treatment initiation rate (DTIR) and antiviral effect in reducing transmission (AVT). Irrespective of location and AVT, widespread antiviral treatment of symptomatic adult infections (≥20% DTIR) prevented the majority of COVID-19 deaths, and recruiting 6% of all adult symptomatic infections daily reduced mortality by a third in all countries. Furthermore, our model projected that targeting antiviral treatment to the oldest age group (65 years old and older, DTIR of 20%) can prevent over 47% of deaths. Our results suggest that early antiviral treatment (as soon as possible after inception of infection) is needed to mitigate transmission, preventing 50% more infections compared to late treatment (started 3 to 5 days after symptoms onset). Our results highlight the synergistic effect of vaccination and antiviral treatment: as the vaccination rate increases, antivirals have a larger relative impact on population transmission. These results suggest that antiviral treatments can become a strategic tool that, in combination with vaccination, can significantly reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths and can help control SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementScientific Computing Infrastructure at Fred Hutch was funded by ORIP grant S10OD028685.

%X Importance Public health vaccination recommendations for COVID-19 primary series and boosters in previously infected individuals differ worldwide. As infection with SARS-CoV-2 is often asymptomatic, it remains to be determined if vaccine immunogenicity is comparable in all previously infected subjects. We present detailed immunological evidence to clarify the requirements for one-or two-dose primary vaccination series for naturally primed individuals.Objective Evaluate the immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in healthcare workers (HCWs) who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection.Design Multicentric observational prospective cohort study of HCWs with a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection designed to evaluate the dynamics of T and B cells immune responses to primary infection and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination over 12 months.Participants Unvaccinated HCWs with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were selected based on the presence or absence of symptoms at infection and serostatus at enrollment. Age- and sex-matched adults not infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination were included as naïve controls.Exposure Vaccination with Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) Immunity score (zero to three), before and after vaccination, based on anti-RBD IgG ratio, serum capacity to neutralize live virus and IFN-γ secretion capacity in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools above the positivity threshold for each of the three assays. We compared the immunity score between groups based on subjects’ symptoms at diagnosis and/or serostatus prior to vaccination.Results None of the naïve participants (n=14) showed a maximal immunity score of three following one dose of vaccine compared to 84% of the previously infected participants (n=55). All recovered individuals who did not have an immunity score of three were seronegative prior to vaccination, and 67% had not reported symptoms resulting from their initial infection. Following one dose of vaccine, their immune responses were comparable to naïve individuals, with significantly weaker responses than those who were symptomatic during infection.Conclusions and Relevance Individuals who did not develop symptoms during their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and were seronegative prior to vaccination present immune responses comparable to that of naïve individuals. These findings highlight the importance of administering the complete two-dose primary regimen and following boosters of mRNA vaccines to individuals who experienced asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.Question Is a single dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine sufficient to induce robust immune responses in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection?Findings In this cohort of 55 health care workers previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, we show that the absence of symptoms during initial infection and negative serostatus prior to vaccination predict the strength of immune responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Lack of symptoms and a negative serostatus prior to vaccination leads to immune responses comparable to naïve individuals.Meaning Our results support a two-dose primary series requirement for any individual with prior history of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (VR2172712) and the COVID19 Immunity Task Force/Public Health Agency of Canada.

%X Background The use of fractional dose regimens of COVID-19 vaccines has the potential to accelerate vaccination rates in low-income countries. Dose-finding studies of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) have suggested that a fractional dose induces comparable antibody responses to the full, licensed dose in people below 55 years old. Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of a fractional dose regimen of the BNT162b2 vaccine.Methods REDU-VAC is a participant-blinded, randomised, phase 4, multicentre, non-inferiority study investigating safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of BNT162b2. Adults aged between 18 and 55 years, without uncontrolled co-morbidities, either previously infected or infection naïve, were eligible and recruited at five sites across Belgium. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 20µg/20µg (fractional dose) or 30µg/30µg (full dose) of BNT162b2, administered intra-muscularly at a three-week interval. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG titres at 28 days post second dose between the reduced and the full dose regimens. The reduced dose was considered non-inferior to the full dose if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the GMR was greater than 0.67. The primary analysis was done on the per-protocol population, including infection naïve participants only.Findings Between April 19 and April 23, 2021, 145 participants were enrolled in the study and randomized, of whom 141 were vaccinated and reached the primary endpoint. Participants were mostly female (69.5%), of European origin (95%), with a mean age of 40.4 years (SD 7.9). At 28 days post second dose, the geometric mean titre (GMT) of SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG of the reduced dose regimen (1,705 BAU/mL) was not non-inferior to the full dose regimen (2,387 BAU/mL), with a GMR of 0.714 (two-sided 95% CI 0.540-0.944). No serious adverse events occurred.Conclusions While non-inferiority of the reduced dose regimen was not demonstrated, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG titre was only moderately lower than that of the full dose regimen and, importantly, still markedly higher than the reported antibody response to the licensed adenoviral vector vaccines. These data suggest that reduced doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine may offer additional benefit as compared to the vaccines currently in use in most low and middle-income countries, warranting larger immunogenicity and effectiveness trials. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04852861).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04852861Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Belgian Federal Government and the Research Foundation - Flanders.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Ethics Committee of Erasme Hospital (Brussels, Belgium) gave ethical approval for this work (P2021/251).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In the face of a long-running pandemic, understanding the drivers of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission is crucial for the rational management of COVID-19 disease burden. Keeping schools open has emerged as a vital societal imperative during the pandemic, but in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can contribute to further prolonging the pandemic. In this context, the role of schools in driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission acquires critical importance. Here we model in-school transmission from first principles to investigate the effectiveness of layered mitigation strategies on limiting in-school spread. We examine the effect of masks and air quality (ventilation, filtration and ionizers) on steady-state viral load in classrooms, as well as on the number of particles inhaled by an uninfected person. The effectiveness of these measures in limiting viral transmission is assessed for variants with different levels of mean viral load (Wuhan, Delta, Omicron). Our results suggest that a layered mitigation strategy can be used effectively to limit in-school transmission, with certain limitations. First, poorly designed strategies (insufficient ventilation, no masks, staying open under high levels of community transmission) will permit in-school spread even if some level of mitigation is ostensibly present. Second, for viral variants that are sufficiently contagious, it may be difficult to construct any set of interventions capable of blocking transmission once an infected individual is present, underscoring the importance of other measures. Our findings provide several practical recommendations: the use of a layered mitigation strategy that is designed to limit transmission, with other measures such as frequent surveillance testing and smaller class sizes (such as by offering remote schooling options to those who prefer it) as needed.Competing Interest StatementA.C. and M.S. are employees of Fractal Therapeutics.

%X Background Vaccines can be less immunogenic in people living with HIV (PLWH), but for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations this is unknown.Methods and Findings A prospective cohort study to examine the immunogenicity of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines in adult PLWH, without prior COVID-19, compared to HIV-negative controls. The primary endpoint was the anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG response after mRNA vaccination. Secondary endpoints included the serological response after vector vaccination, anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response and reactogenicity.Between February-September 2021, 1154 PLWH (median age 53 [IQR 44-60], 86% male) and 440 controls (median age 43 [IQR 33-53], 29% male) were included. 884 PLWH received BNT162b2, 100 mRNA-1273, 150 ChAdOx1-S, and 20 Ad26.COV2.S. 99% were on antiretroviral therapy, 98% virally suppressed, and the median CD4+T-cell count was 710 cells/µL [IQR 520-913]. 247 controls received mRNA-1273, 94 BNT162b2, 26 ChAdOx1-S and 73 Ad26.COV2.S. After mRNA vaccination, geometric mean concentration was 1418 BAU/mL in PLWH (95%CI 1322-1523), and after adjustment for age, sex, and vaccine type, HIV-status remained associated with a decreased response (0.607, 95%CI 0.508-0.725). In PLWH vaccinated with mRNA-based vaccines, higher antibody responses were predicted by CD4+T-cell counts 250-500 cells/µL (2.845, 95%CI 1.876-4.314) or &gt;500 cells/µL (2.936, 95%CI 1.961-4.394), whilst a viral load &gt;50 copies/mL was associated with a reduced response (0.454, 95%CI 0.286-0.720). Increased IFN-γ, CD4+, and CD8+T-cell responses were observed after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides in ELISpot and activation induced marker assays, comparable to controls. Reactogenicity was generally mild without vaccine-related SAE.Conclusion After vaccination with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were reduced in PLWH. To reach and maintain the same serological responses and vaccine efficacy as HIV-negative controls, additional vaccinations are probably required.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThe trial was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NL9214). https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/9214Funding StatementThis trial was funded by The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) grant number 10430072010008.

%X Objective Cancer is a comorbidity that leads to progressive worsening of Covid-19 with increased mortality. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis to yield evidence of adverse outcomes of Covid-19 in gynecologic cancer.Methods Searches through PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and medRxiv to find articles on the outcome of gynecologic cancer with Covid-19 (24 July 2021-19 February 2022). Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool is used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Pooled odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), random-effects model were presented. This study was registered to PROSPERO (CRD42021256557).Results We accepted 51 studies (1991 gynecologic cancer with Covid-19). Covid-19 infection was lower in gynecologic cancer vs hematologic cancer (OR 0.71, CI 0.56-0.90, p 0.005). Severe Covid and death were lower in gynecologic cancer vs lung and hematologic cancer (OR 0.36, CI 0.16-0.80, p 0.01), (OR 0.52, CI 0.44-0.62, p &lt;0.0001), (OR 0.26, CI 0.10-0.67 p 0.005), (OR 0.63, CI 0.47-0.83, p 0.001) respectively. Increased Covid death is seen in gynecologic cancer vs breast, non-covid cancer, and non-cancer covid (OR 1.50, CI 1.20-1.88, p 0.0004), (OR 11.83, CI 8.20-17.07, p &lt;0.0001), (OR 2.98, CI 2.23-3.98, p &lt;0.0001) respectively.Conclusion Gynecologic cancer has higher Covid-19 adverse outcomes compared to non-cancer, breast cancer, non-metastatic, and Covid-19 negative population. Gynecologic cancer has fewer Covid-19 adverse outcomes compared to other cancer types, lung cancer, and hematologic cancer. These findings may aid health policies and services during the ongoing global pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocols https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=256557 Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X SARS-CoV-2 ‘Variants of Concern’ (VOCs) continue to reshape the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, why some VOCs, like Omicron, become globally dominant while the spread of others is limited is not fully understood. To address this question, we investigated the VOC Mu, which was first identified in Colombia in late 2020. Our study demonstrates that, although Mu is less sensitive to neutralization compared to variants that preceded it, it did not spread significantly outside of South and Central America. Additionally, we find evidence that the response to Mu was impeded by reporting delays and gaps in the global genomic surveillance system. Our findings suggest that immune evasion alone was not sufficient to outcompete highly transmissible variants that were circulating concurrently with Mu. Insights into the complex relationship between genomic and epidemiological characteristics of previous variants should inform our response to variants that are likely to emerge in the future.Competing Interest StatementNDG and JRF are paid consultants for Tempus Labs, and NDG is a paid consultant for the National Basketball Association for work related to COVID-19 but is outside the submitted work.

%X The PARIS (Protection Associated with Rapid Immunity to SARS-CoV-2) cohort follows health care workers with and without documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since April 2020. We report our findings regarding SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibody stability and protection from infection in the pre-variant era. We analyzed data from 400 healthcare workers (150 seropositive and 250 seronegative at enrollment) for a median of 84 days. The SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibody titers were highly variable with antibody levels decreasing over the first three months, followed by a relative stabilization. We found that both more advanced age (&gt;40 years) and female sex were associated with higher antibody levels (1.6-fold and 1.4-fold increases, respectively). Only six percent of the initially seropositive participants “seroreverted”. We documented a total of 11 new SARS-CoV-2 infections (ten naïve participants, one previously infected participant without detectable antibodies, p&lt;0.01) indicating that spike antibodies limit the risk of re-infection. These observations, however, only apply to SARS-CoV-2 variants antigenically similar to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 ones. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers mounted upon infection are stable over several months in most people and provide protection from infection with antigenically similar viruses.summary The levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibodies mounted upon infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variants are highly variable, stabilize at an individual level after three months and provide protection from infection with homologous virus.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays (U.S. Provisional Application Numbers: 62/994,252, 63/018,457, 63/020,503 and 63/024,436) and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (U.S. Provisional Application Number: 63/251,020) which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%T Endemicity is not a victory: the unmitigated downside risks of widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission

%X We have entered a new phase of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as the strategy of relying solely on the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to bring the pandemic to an end has become infeasible. In response, public-health authorities in many countries have advocated for a strategy of using the vaccines to limit morbidity and mortality while permitting unchecked SARS-CoV-2 spread (“learning to live with the disease”). The feasibility of this strategy is critically dependent on the infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19. An expectation exists, both in the lay public and in the scientific community, that future waves of the virus will exhibit decreased IFR, either due to viral attenuation or the progressive buildup of immunity. In this work, we examine the basis for that expectation, assessing the impact of virulence on transmission. Our findings suggest that large increases in virulence for SARS-CoV-2 would result in minimal loss of transmission, implying that the IFR may be free to increase or decrease under neutral evolutionary drift. We further examine the effect of changes in the IFR on the steady-state death toll under conditions of endemic COVID-19. Our modeling suggests that endemic SARS-CoV-2 implies vast transmission resulting in yearly US COVID-19 death tolls numbering in the hundreds of thousands under many plausible scenarios, with even modest increases in the IFR leading to an unsustainable mortality burden. Our findings thus highlight the critical importance of enacting a concerted strategy (involving for example global access to vaccines, therapeutics, prophylactics and nonpharmaceutical interventions) to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic outcomes. Our findings also highlight the importance of continued investment in novel biomedical interventions to prevent viral transmission.Competing Interest StatementM.S. and A.C. are employees of Fractal Therapeutics, Inc.Funding StatementA.N. acknowledges funding from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant No. DGE-1762114.

%X Two years after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there is still a need for better ways to assess the risk of transmission in congregate spaces. We deployed active air samplers to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in real-world settings across communities in the Upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Over 29 weeks, we collected 527 air samples from 15 congregate settings and detected 106 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in air collected from daily and weekly sampling intervals. We expanded the utility of air surveillance to test for 40 other respiratory pathogens. Surveillance data revealed differences in timing and location of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus detection in the community. In addition, we obtained SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from air samples to identify variant lineages. Collectively, this shows air surveillance is a scalable, cost-effective, and high throughput alternative to individual testing for detecting respiratory pathogens in congregate settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was made possible by financial support through Rockefeller Regional Accelerator for Genomic Surveillance (133 AAJ4558), Wisconsin Department of Health Services Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity funds (144 AAJ8216), and National Institutes of Health grant (U01DA053893).

%X Importance Previous studies have analyzed effectiveness of booster mRNA Covid-19 vaccination and compared it with 2-dose primary series for both Delta and Omicron variants. Observational studies that estimate effectiveness by comparing outcomes among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may suffer from residual confounding and exposure misclassification.Objective To estimate relative effectiveness of booster vaccination versus the 2-dose primary series with self-controlled study designDesign, Setting and Participants We used the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse to identify U.S. Veterans enrolled in care ≥2 years who received the 2-dose primary mRNA Covid-19 vaccine series and a mRNA Covid-19 booster following expanded recommendation for booster vaccination, and who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the Delta (9/23/2021-11/30/2021) or Omicron (1/1/22-3/1/22) predominant period. Among them, we conducted a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analysis to compare odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a booster exposure interval versus a control interval.Exposures control interval (days 4-6 post-booster vaccination, presumably prior to gain of booster immunity), and booster exposure interval (days 14-16 post-booster vaccination, presumably following gain of booster immunity)Outcomes and Measures Positive PCR or antigen SARS-CoV-2 test. Separately for Delta and Omicron periods, we used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) of a positive test for the booster versus control interval and calculated relative effectiveness of booster versus 2-dose primary series as (1-OR)*100. The SCRI approach implicitly controlled for time-fixed confounders.Results We found 42 individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the control interval and 14 in the booster exposure interval during Delta period, and 137 and 66, respectively, in Omicron period. For the booster versus 2-dose primary series, the odds of infection were 70% (95%CI: 42%, 84%) lower during the Delta period and 56% (95%CI: 38%, 67%) lower during Omicron. Results were similar for ages &lt;65 and ≥65 years in the Omicron period. In sensitivity analyses among those with prior Covid-19 history, and age stratification, ORs were similar to the main analysis.Conclusions Booster vaccination was more effective relative to a 2-dose primary series, the relative effectiveness was consistent across age groups and was higher during the Delta predominant period than during the Omicron period.Competing Interest StatementCK, JS, GZ, EP and YY-X acknowledge having received funding from Pfizer for other research projects other than this one.

%T Occurrence and transmission potential of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: update of a living systematic review and meta-analysis

%X BACKGROUND Debate about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues. The amount of evidence is increasing and study designs have changed over time. We updated a living systematic review to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) What is the infectiousness of asymptomatic and presymptomatic, compared with symptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 infection? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a population is accounted for by people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic?METHODS AND FINDINGS The protocol was first published on 1 April 2020 and last updated on 18 June 2021. We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv, aggregated in a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature, most recently on 6 July 2021. Studies of people with PCR-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2, which documented symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up, or mathematical modelling studies were included. Studies restricted to people already diagnosed, of single individuals or families, or without sufficient follow-up were excluded. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with a bespoke checklist and modelling studies with a published checklist. All data syntheses were done using random effects models. Review question (1): We included 130 studies.Heterogeneity was high so we did not estimate a mean proportion of asymptomatic infections overall (interquartile range 14-50%, prediction interval 2-90%), or in 84 studies based on screening of defined populations (interquartile range 20-65%, prediction interval 4-94%). In 46 studies based on contact or outbreak investigations, the summary proportion asymptomatic was 19% (95% CI 15-25%, prediction interval 2-70%). (2) The secondary attack rate in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection compared with symptomatic infection was 0.32 (95% CI 0.16-0.64, prediction interval 0.11-0-95, 8 studies). (3) In 13 modelling studies fit to data, the proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 transmission from presymptomatic individuals was higher than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the evidence include high heterogeneity and high risks of selection and information bias in studies that were not designed to measure persistently asymptomatic infection, and limited information about variants of concern or in people who have been vaccinated.CONCLUSIONS Based on studies published up to July 2021, most SARS-CoV-2 infections were not persistently asymptomatic and asymptomatic infections were less infectious than symptomatic infections. Summary estimates from meta-analysis may be misleading when variability between studies is extreme and prediction intervals should be presented. Future studies should determine the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by variants of concern and in people with immunity following vaccination or previous infection. Without prospective longitudinal studies with methods that minimise selection and measurement biases, further updates with the study types included in this living systematic review are unlikely to be able to provide a reliable summary estimate of the proportion of asymptomatic infections caused by SARS-CoV-2.REVIEW PROTOCOL Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/9ewys/)Why was this study done?▪ The proportion of people who will remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), is debated.▪ Studies that assess people at just one time point overestimate the proportion of true asymptomatic infection because those who go on to develop covid-19 symptoms will be wrongly classified as asymptomatic, but other types of study might underestimate the proportion if, for example, people with symptoms are more likely to be included in a study population.▪ The number of published studies about SARS-CoV-2 is increasing continuously, types of studies are changing and, since 2021, vaccines have become available, and variants of concern have emerged.What did the researchers do and find?▪ We updated a living systematic review through 6 July 2021, using automated workflows that speed up the review processes, and allow the review to be updated when relevant new evidence becomes available.▪ In 130 studies, we found an interquartile range of 14-50% (prediction interval 2-90%) of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection that was persistently asymptomatic; owing to heterogeneity, we did not estimate a summary proportion.▪ Contacts of people with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection are less likely to become infected than contacts of people with symptomatic infection (risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.16-0.64, prediction interval 0.11-0.95, 8 studies).What do these findings mean?▪ Up to mid-2021, most people with SARS-CoV-2 were not persistently asymptomatic and asymptomatic infection was less infectious than symptomatic infection.▪ In the presence of high between-study variability, summary estimates from meta-analysis may be misleading and prediction intervals should be presented.▪ Future studies about asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by variants of concern and in people with immunity following vaccination or previous infection should be specifically designed, using methods to minimise biases in the selection of study participants and in ascertainment, classification and follow-up of symptom status.Competing Interest StatementAll authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: NL is an academic editor at PLOS Medicine, received the grant funding from the organisations declared above, is a member of the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force, and is on the scientific board of Sefunda, a start-up company that develops point-of-care diagnostics for sexually transmitted infections.

%X Seychelles, an archipelago of 155 islands in the Indian Ocean, had confirmed 24,788 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the 31st December 2021. The first SARS-CoV-2 cases in Seychelles were reported on the 14th of March 2020, but cases remained low until January 2021, when a surge of SARS-CoV-2 cases was observed on the islands. Here, we investigated the potential drivers of the surge by genomic analysis 1,056 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected in Seychelles between 14th March 2020 and 31st December 2021. The Seychelles genomes were classified into 32 Pango lineages, 1,042 of which fell within four variants of concern i.e., Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron. Sporadic cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Seychelles in 2020 were mainly of lineage B.1 (European origin) but this lineage was rapidly replaced by Beta variant starting January 2021, and which was also subsequently replaced by the Delta variant in May 2021 that dominated till November 2021 when Omicron cases were identified. Using ancestral state reconstruction approach, we estimated at least 78 independent SARS-CoV-2 introduction events into Seychelles during the study period. Majority of viral introductions into Seychelles occurred in 2021, despite substantial COVID-19 restrictions in place during this period.

%X In Dec 2021-Feb 2022, an intense and unprecedented co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants with high genetic diversity raised the question of possible co-infections between variants and how to detect them. Using 11 mixes of Delta:Omicron isolates at different ratios, we evaluated the performance of 4 different sets of primers used for whole-genome sequencing and we developed an unbiased bioinformatics method which can detect all co-infections irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages involved. Applied on 21,387 samples collected between weeks 49-2021 and 08-2022 from random genomic surveillance in France, we detected 53 co-infections between different lineages. The prevalence of Delta and Omicron (BA.1) co-infections and Omicron lineages BA.1 and BA.2 co-infections were estimated at 0.18% and 0.26%, respectively. Among 6,242 hospitalized patients, the intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were 1.64%, 4.81% and 15.38% in Omicron, Delta and Delta/Omicron patients, respectively. No BA.1/BA.2 co-infections were reported among ICU admitted patients. Although SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were rare in this study, their proper detection is crucial to evaluate their clinical impact and the risk of the emergence of potential recombinants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSante publique France, the French national public health agency.

%X Vaccines are the most important means to overcome the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. They induce specific antibody and T-cell responses but it remains open how well vaccine-induced immunity is preserved over time following homologous and heterologous immunization regimens. Here, we compared the dynamics of humoral and cellular immune responses up to 5 months after homologous or heterologous vaccination with either ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 (ChAd) or BNT162b2 (BNT) or both. Antibody responses significantly waned after vaccination, irrespective of the regimen. The capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 – including variants of concern such as Delta or Omicron – was superior after heterologous compared to homologous BNT vaccination, both of which resulted in longer-lasting humoral immunity than homologous ChAd immunization. T-cell responses showed less waning irrespective of the vaccination regimen. These findings demonstrate that heterologous vaccination with ChAd and BNT is a potent approach to induce long-term humoral and cellular immune protection.Evidence before this study Due to some rare severe side effects after the administration of the adenoviral vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, many countries recommended a heterologous vaccination scheme including mRNA vaccines like BNT162b2 for the second dose. We performed a PubMed search (with no restrictions on time span) using the search terms “SARS-CoV-2” and “heterologous vaccination” and obtained 247 results. Only a fraction of manuscripts included direct comparisons of patient cohorts that received either a heterologous or a homologous vaccination regimen. Of those, the vast majority investigated only short-term immunogenicity after vaccination. Thus, little is known about the long-term maintenance of immunity by heterologous compared to homologous vaccination.Added value of this study We add a very comprehensive and comparative study investigating heterologous and homologous vaccination regimens early and late after vaccination. Key features include the number of patients (n = 473), the number of vaccination cohorts (n= 3), the fact that samples were derived from three independent study centers and comparative analyses were performed at two independent study centers, as well as in-depth investigation of humoral and T cellular immunity.Implications of all the available evidence The recent data creates a line of evidence that heterologous vaccination, compared to homologous vaccination regimens, results in at least non-inferior maintenance of humoral and cellular immunity. The enhanced understanding of immunity induced by individual vaccination regimens is crucial for further recommendations regarding the necessity, timing and choice of additional vaccinations and public health policies.Competing Interest StatementJH reports grants and speaker honoraria from Pfizer, outside the study.

%X Background Emerging and future SARS-CoV-2 variants may jeopardize the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. Therefore, it is important to know how the different vaccines perform against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants.Methods In a prospective cohort of 165 SARS-CoV-2 naive health care workers, vaccinated with either one of four vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, AZD1222 or Ad26.COV2.S), we performed a head-to-head comparison of the ability of sera to recognize and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs; Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron). Repeated serum sampling was performed 5 times during a year (from January 2021 till January 2022), including before and after booster vaccination with BNT162b2.Findings Four weeks after completing the initial vaccination series, SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralizing antibody titers were highest in recipients of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 (geometric mean titers (GMT) of 197 [95% CI 149-260] and 313 [95% CI 218-448], respectively), and substantially lower in those vaccinated with the adenovirus vector-based vaccines AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S (GMT of 26 [95% CI 18-37] and 14 [95% CI 8-25] IU/ml, respectively). These findings were robust for adjustment to age and sex. VOCs neutralization was reduced in all vaccine groups, with the largest (9- to 80-fold) reduction in neutralization observed against the Omicron variant. The booster BNT162b2 vaccination increased neutralizing antibody titers for all groups with substantial improvement against the VOCs including the Omicron variant. Study limitations include the lack of cellular immunity data.Conclusions Overall, this study shows that the mRNA vaccines appear superior to adenovirus vector-based vaccines in inducing neutralizing antibodies against VOCs four weeks after initial vaccination and after booster vaccination.Competing Interest StatementAmsterdam UMC filed a patent application on SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies including the ones used in this manuscript.Funding Statementthe Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) ZonMw (no. 10430022010023 no. 10150062010002 no. 91818627)the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (no.

%X A simple method is devised to estimate the onset ratio of COVID-19 patients from the proportion of untraceable patients tested positive, which allows us to obtain the number of asymptomatic patients, the number of infectious patients and the effective reproduction number. The recent data in Tokyo indicate that there are about six to ten times as many infectious patients in the city as the daily confirmed new cases. It is shown that, besides social distancing and use of effective masks, a quarantine measure on non-symptomatic patients is critically important in controlling the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 18K03573.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:N/AI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Longer-term humoral responses to two-dose COVID-19 vaccines remain incompletely characterized in people living with HIV (PLWH), as do initial responses to a third dose.Methods We measured antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain, ACE2 displacement and viral neutralization against wild-type and Omicron strains up to six months following two-dose vaccination, and one month following the third dose, in 99 PLWH receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, and 152 controls.Results Though humoral responses naturally decline following two-dose vaccination, we found no evidence of lower antibody concentrations nor faster rates of antibody decline in PLWH compared to controls after accounting for sociodemographic, health and vaccine-related factors. We also found no evidence of poorer viral neutralization in PLWH after two doses, nor evidence that a low nadir CD4+ T-cell count compromised responses. Post-third-dose humoral responses substantially exceeded post-second-dose levels, though anti-Omicron responses were consistently weaker than against wild-type.Nevertheless, post-third-dose responses in PLWH were comparable to or higher than controls. An mRNA-1273 third dose was the strongest consistent correlate of higher post-third-dose responses.Conclusion PLWH receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy mount strong antibody responses after two- and three-dose COVID-19 vaccination. Results underscore the immune benefits of third doses in light of Omicron.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by funding from Genome BC, the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, and the BCCDC Foundation for Public Health through a rapid SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research initiative in BC award (VAC-009 to ZLB, MAB).

%X Genetic recombination is a major evolutionary mechanism among RNA viruses, and it is common in coronaviruses, including those infecting humans. A few SARS-CoV-2 recombinants have been reported to date whose genome harbored combinations of mutations from different mutants or variants, but a single patient’s sample was analyzed, and the virus was not isolated. Here, we re-port the gradual creation of a hybrid genome of B.1.160 and Alpha variants in a lymphoma patient chronically infected for 14 months, and we isolated the recombinant virus. The hybrid genome was obtained by next-generation sequencing, and recombination sites were confirmed by PCR. This consisted of a parental B.1.160 backbone interspersed with two fragments, including the spike gene, from an Alpha variant. Analysis of seven sequential samples from the patient decoded the recombination steps, including the initial infection with a B.1.160 variant, then a concurrent infec-tion with this variant and an Alpha variant, the generation of hybrid genomes, and eventually the emergence of a predominant recombinant virus isolated at the end of the patient’s follow-up. This case exemplifies the recombination process of SARS-CoV-2 in real life, and it calls for intensifying genomic surveillance in patients coinfected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants, and more gener-ally with several RNA viruses, as this may lead to the creation of new viruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the French Government under the Investments for the Future program managed by the National Agency for Research (ANR) (Mediterranee-Infection 10-IAHU-03), by the Region Provence Alpes Cote d Azur and European funding FEDER PRIMMI (Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional-Plateformes de Recherche et d'Innovation Mutualisees Mediterranee Infection) (FEDER PA 0000320 PRIMMI), and by the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation (ministere de l'Enseignement superieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation) and the French Ministry of Solidarity and Health (Ministere des Solidarites et de la Sante).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study has been approved by the ethics committee of University Hospital Institute (IHU) Mediterranee Infection (No. 2022-008).

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccines or infection. However, whether Omicron triggers cross-reactive humoral responses to other variants of concern (VOCs) remains unknown. We use plasma from 20 unvaccinated and seven vaccinated individuals infected by Omicron BA.1 to test binding, Fc effector function and neutralization against VOCs. In unvaccinated individuals, Fc effector function and binding antibodies target Omicron and other VOCs at comparable levels. However, Omicron BA.1-triggered neutralization is not extensively cross-reactive for VOCs (14 to 31-fold titer reduction) and we observe 4-fold decreased titers against Omicron BA.2. In contrast, vaccination followed by breakthrough Omicron infection was associated with improved cross-neutralization of VOCs, with titers exceeding 1:2,100. This has important implications for vulnerability of unvaccinated Omicron-infected individuals to reinfection by circulating and emerging VOCs. While Omicron-based immunogens may be adequate boosters, they are unlikely to be superior to existing vaccines for priming in SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementPLM is supported by the South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Innovation and National Research Foundation of South Africa, the SA Medical Research Council SHIP program, the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA).

%X Wastewater surveillance serves as a promising approach to elucidate the silent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a given community by detecting the virus in wastewater treatment facilities. This study monitored the viral RNA abundance at one WWTP and three communities during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Yanta district of Xi’an city from December 2021 to January 2022. To further understand the decay of the coronavirus in sewage pipes, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was seeded in two recirculating water systems and operated for 90 days. Based on the viral abundance in the wastewater of Xi’an and the above data regarding the decay of coronavirus in sewage pipes, Monte Carol simulations were performed to estimate the infectious cases in Xi’an. The results suggested that the delta variant was first detected on Dec-10, five days earlier than the reported date of clinical samples. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on December 18 in the monitored community two days earlier than the first case and was consecutively detected in the following two sampling times. In pipelines without biofilms, the results showed that high temperature significantly reduced the viral RNA abundance by 2.18 log10 GC/L after experiencing 20 km travel distance, while only a 1.68 log10 GC/L reduction was observed in the pipeline with a low water temperature. After 90 days of operation, the biofilm matured in the pipeline in both systems. Reductions of viral RNA abundance of 2.14 and 4.79 log10 GC/L were observed in low- and high-temperature systems with mature biofilms, respectively. Based on the above results, we adjusted the input parameters for Monte Carol simulation and estimated 23.3, 50.1, 127.3 and 524.2 infected persons in December 14, 18, 22 and 26, respectively, which is largely consistent with the clinical reports. This work highlights the viability of wastewater surveillance for the early warning of COVID-19 at both the community and city levels, which represents a valuable complement to clinical approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNational Natural Science Foundation of China (81903372) and Science and Technology Department of Jiangxi Province, China (20202BBGL73053)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X COVID-19 emergency use authorizations and approvals for vaccines were achieved in record time. However, there remains a need to develop additional safe, effective, easy-to-produce, and inexpensive prevention to reduce the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. This need is due to difficulties in vaccine manufacturing and distribution, vaccine hesitancy, and, critically, the increased prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with greater contagiousness or reduced sensitivity to immunity. Antibodies from eggs of hens (immunoglobulin Y; IgY) that were administered receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were developed as nasal drops to capture the virus on the nasal mucosa. Although initially raised against the 2019 novel coronavirus index strain (2019- nCoV), these anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgY surprisingly had indistinguishable enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay binding against variants of concern that have emerged, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529). This is distinct for sera from immunized or convalescent patients. Culture neutralization titers against available Alpha, Beta, and Delta were also indistinguishable from the index SARS-CoV-2 strain. Efforts to develop these IgY for clinical use demonstrated that the intranasal anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgY preparation showed no binding (cross-reactivity) to a variety of human tissues and had an excellent safety profile in rats following 28-day intranasal delivery of the formulated IgY. A double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled phase 1 study evaluating single-ascending and multiple doses of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgY administered intranasally for 14 days in 48 healthy adults also demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability profile, and no evidence of systemic absorption. As these antiviral IgY have broad selectivity against many variants of concern, are fast to produce, and are a low-cost product, their use as prophylaxis to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission warrants further evaluation.

%X The impact of SARS-CoV2 vaccination in cancer patients remains incompletely understood given the heterogeneity of cancer and cancer therapies. We assessed vaccine-induced antibody response to the SARS-CoV2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in 57 patients with B cell malignancies with and without active B cell-targeted therapy. Ancestral- and Omicron-reactive antibody levels were determined by ELISA and neutralization assays. In over one third of vaccinated patients at the pre-booster timepoint, there were no ELISA-detectable antibodies against either the ancestral strain or Omicron variant. The lack of vaccine-induced antibodies was predominantly in patients receiving active therapy such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). While booster immunization was able to induce detectable antibodies in a small fraction of seronegative patients, the benefit was disproportionately evident in patients not on active therapy. Importantly, in patients with post-booster ELISA-detectable antibodies, there was a positive correlation of antibody levels against the ancestral strain and Omicron variant. Booster immunization increased overall antibody levels, including neutralizing antibody titers against the ancestral strain and Omicron variant; however, predominantly in patients without active therapy. Furthermore, ancestral strain neutralizing antibody titers were about 5-fold higher in comparison with those to Omicron, suggesting that even with booster administration, there may be reduced protection against the Omicron variant. Interestingly, in almost all patients regardless of active therapy, including those unable to generate detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV2 spike, we observed comparable levels of EBV, influenza, and common cold coronavirus reactive antibodies demonstrating that B cell-targeting therapies primarily impair de novo but not pre-existing antibody levels. These findings suggest that patients with B cell malignancies on active therapy may be at disproportionately higher risk to new versus endemic viral infection and suggest utility for vaccination prior to B cell-targeted therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and the National Institutes of Health under grant number P30 CA016058.

%X Point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid detection technologies are poised to aid gold-standard technologies in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, yet shortcomings in the capability to perform critically needed complex detection—such as multiplexed detection for viral variant surveillance—may limit their widespread adoption. Herein, we developed a robust multiplexed CRISPR-based detection using LwaCas13a and PsmCas13b to simultaneously diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection and pinpoint the causative SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC)— including globally dominant VOCs Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529)—all while maintaining high levels of accuracy upon the detection of multiple SARS-CoV-2 gene targets. The platform has several attributes suitable for POC use: premixed, freeze-dried reagents for easy use and storage; convenient direct-to-eye or smartphone-based readouts; and a one-pot variant of the multiplexed detection. To reduce reliance on proprietary reagents and enable sustainable use of such a technology in low- and middle-income countries, we locally produced and formulated our own recombinase polymerase amplification reaction and demonstrated its equivalent efficiency to commercial counterparts. Our tool—CRISPR-based detection for simultaneous COVID-19 diagnosis and variant surveillance which can be locally manufactured—may enable sustainable use of CRISPR diagnostics technologies for COVID- 19 and other diseases in POC settings.Competing Interest StatementO.A., J.G., and F.Z. are co-founders of Sherlock Biosciences and Pine Trees Health.

%X Hemodialysis patients (HD patients) have a high health risk from Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this study, we assess the impact of a third vaccine dose (3D) on antibody levels and T cell response in HD patients and compare the results to those of a healthy control group.We conducted a prospective cohort study consisting of 60 HD patients and 65 healthy controls. All of them received two doses of the Comirnaty mRNA vaccine and a third mRNA vaccine dose (Spikevax or Comirnaty). The SARS-CoV-2 S antibody response in all participants was measured 6 months after the second vaccine dose and 6 to 8 weeks after administration of the 3D. We also assessed INF-γ secretion 6–8 weeks after the 3D in 24 healthy controls, 17 HD patients with a normal and 20 HD patients with a low or no antibody response after the second dose. The groups were compared using univariate quantile regressions and multiple analyses. The adverse effects of vaccines were assessed via a questionnaire.After the 3D, the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and INF-γ titers of most HD patients were comparable to those of healthy controls. A subgroup of HD patients who had shown a diminished antibody response after the first two vaccine doses developed a significantly lower antibody and INF-γ response compared to responder HD patients and controls, even after the 3D. A new strategy is needed to protect this patient group from severe COVID-19 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of Lower Austria gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background MVC-COV1901 is a subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on the prefusion spike protein S-2P and adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide. Although MVC-COV1901 has been licensed for emergency use for adults in Taiwan, the safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 in adolescents remained unknown. As young people play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and epidemiology, a vaccine approved for adolescents and eventually, children, will be important in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods This study is a prospective, double-blind, multi-center phase 2 trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine MVC-COV1901 in adolescents. Healthy adolescents from age of 12 to 17 years were recruited and randomly assigned (6:1) to receive two intramuscular doses of either MVC-COV1901 or placebo at 28 days apart. The primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity from the day of first vaccination (Day 1) to 28 days after the second vaccination (Day 57), and immunogenicity of MVC COV1901 in adolescents as compared to young adult vaccinees in terms of neutralizing antibody titers and seroconversion rate. The secondary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 as compared to placebo in adolescents in terms of immunoglobulin titers and neutralizing antibody titers over the study period.Results Between July 21, 2021 and December 22, 2021, a total of 399 adolescent participants were included for safety evaluation after enrollment to receive at least one dose of either MVC-COV1901 (N=341) or placebo (N=58). Of these, 334 and 46 participants went on to receive two doses of either MVC-COV1901 or placebo, respectively, and were included in the per protocol set (PPS) for immunogenicity analysis. Adverse events were mostly mild and were similar in MVC-COV1901 and placebo groups. The most commonly reported adverse events were pain/tenderness and malaise/fatigue. All immunogenicity endpoints in the adolescent group were non-inferior to the endpoints seen in the young adult and placebo groups.Conclusions The safety and immunogenicity data presented here showed that MVC-COV1901 has similar safety profile and non-inferior immunogenicity in adolescents compared to young adults.ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT04951388.Competing Interest StatementL.

%X Background By March 2022, around 34 million people in Colombia had received a complete scheme of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) including, mRNA-based vaccines, viral vectored coronavirus vaccines, or the inactivated whole virus vaccine. However, as several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) and interest (VOI) co-circulate in the country, determining the resistance level to vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) is useful to improve the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination programs.Methods Microneutralization assays with the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Colombia during 2020-2021 were performed using serum samples from immunologically naïve individuals between 9 and 13 weeks after receiving complete regimens of CoronaVac, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, or Ad26.COV2.S. The mean neutralization titer (MN50) was calculated by the Reed–Muench method and used to determine differences in vaccine-elicited nAbs against the SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.111, P.1 (Gamma), B.1.621 (Mu), and AY.25.1 (Delta).Results The most administered vaccines in the country, BNT162b2 and CoronaVac, elicited significantly different nAb responses against Mu, as the GMTs were 75.7 and 5.9-fold lower relative to the control lineage (B.1.111), while for Delta were 15.8 and 1.1-fold lower, respectively. In contrast, nAb responses against Mu and Delta were comparable between ChAd0×1-s and Ad26.COV2.S as the GMTs remained around 5 to 7-fold lower relative to B.1.111.Conclusions The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Colombia with a significant capacity to escape from vaccine-elicited nAbs indicates that a booster dose is highly recommended. Furthermore, other non-pharmacological measures should be retained in the vaccinated population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded by Sistema General de Regalias (SGR), project code BPIN 2020000100151.

%X OBJECTIVE Most index cases with novel coronavirus infections transmit disease to just 1 or 2 other individuals, but some individuals ‘super-spread’ – they are infection sources for many secondary cases. Understanding common factors that super-spreaders may share could inform outbreak models.METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, Scopus and preprint servers to identify studies about persons who were each documented as transmitting SARS, MERS or COVID-19 to at least nine other persons. We extracted data from and applied quality assessment to eligible published scientific articles about super-spreaders to describe them demographically: by age, sex, location, occupation, activities, symptom severity, any underlying conditions and disease outcome. We included scientific reports published by mid June 2021.RESULTS The completeness of data reporting was often limited, which meant we could not identify traits such as patient age, sex, occupation, etc. Where demographic information was available, for these coronavirus diseases, the most typical super-spreader was a male age 40+. Most SARS or MERS super-spreaders were very symptomatic and died in hospital settings. In contrast, COVID-19 super-spreaders often had a very mild disease course and most COVID-19 super-spreading happened in community settings.CONCLUSION Although SARS and MERS super-spreaders were often symptomatic, middle- or older-age adults who had a high mortality rate, COVID-19 super-spreaders often had a mild disease course and were documented to be any adult age (from 18 to 91 years old). More outbreak reports should be published with anonymised but useful demographic information to improve understanding of super-spreading, super-spreaders, and the settings that super-spreading happens in.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Emergency Preparedness and Response at Kings College London in partnership with the UK Health Security Agency (UK HSA) and collaboration with the University of East Anglia.

%X Mass vaccination against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was a crucial step in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2021. Even in the face of new variants, it still remains extremely important for reducing hospitalizations and COVID-19 deaths. Only limited data exists about the short- and long-term dynamics of humoral immune response. We present a longitudinal analysis of post-vaccination IgG levels in a cohort of 166 healthcare workers vaccinated with BNT162b2 with weekly follow-up until 35 days past the first dose and monthly follow-up up to 6 months post-vaccination. A subset of the patients continued with follow-up after 6 months and either received a booster dose or got infected during the Delta wave in Romania. Tests were carried out on 1697 samples using a CE-marked IgG ELISA assay developed in-house, containing S1 and N antigens of the wild type virus.Participants infected with SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination mount a quick immune response, reaching peak IgG levels two weeks after the first dose, while IgG levels of previously uninfected participants mount gradually, increasing abruptly after the second dose. Overall higher IgG levels are maintained for the previously infected group 35-70 days after vaccination. The decrease of IgG levels is gradual, with lower overall values in the infection naïve cohort even 7-8 months after vaccination, compared to the previously infected cohort. Administration of a booster dose yielded higher average IgG antibody levels than post second dose in the infection naïve group and comparable levels in the previously infected group.Competing Interest StatementSNF is the CEO of a startup of Pro-Vitam Ltd, and head of the group that developed the combined S1+N ELISA assay, commercialized by the startup.Funding StatementResearch costs were supported by each participating institution.

%T C allele of rs479200 of the host EGLN1 gene - a risk factor for severe COVID-19 (pilot study)

%X Background Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) symptoms can range from asymptomatic, moderate to severe manifestations that result in an overall global case fatality rate of 2-7 %. While each variant has had it challenges, and some variants are more severe than others, risk factors of severe COVID-19 are still under investigation. In this context, the host genetic predisposition is also a crucial factor to investigate. In the present study, we investigated host genotypes of the SNP rs479200 of the host EGLN1 gene, previously implicated in high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), some of whose symptoms such as hypoxia profoundly overlap with severe COVID-19.Methods After informed consent, 158 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients (March 2020 to June 2021) were enrolled in the study. Based on their clinical manifestations, disease severity was categorized by the clinical team. Blood samples were drawn and DNA was extracted from the clot to infer different genotypes of the SNP rs479200 of the host EGLN1 gene. PCR-RFLP analysis of the SNP rs479200 (C &gt; T) was performed with an amplicon size of 367 bp. Various genotypes (TT, TC and CC) were assigned based on the presence/absence of a restriction site (T/GTACA) for restriction enzyme BsrGI. Allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and multinomial logistic regression were performed using statistical tool SPSS version 23 (IBM).Findings We observed that the severe COVID-19 category was composed of comparatively younger patients with mean age (34.9±15.6), compared to asymptomatic and moderate categories whose mean age was 49.7±17.9 and 54.3±15.7, respectively. Preponderance of males and high heterozygosity (TC) was observed across the clinical categories. Notably, the frequency of C allele (0.664) was 2-fold higher than the T allele (0.336) in severe COVID-19 patients, whereas the allele frequencies were similar in asymptomatic and moderate category of COVID-19 patients. Multinomial logistic regression showed an association of genotypes with increasing clinical severity; odds ratio (adjusted OR-11.414 (2.564-50.812)) and (unadjusted OR-6.214 (1.84-20.99)) for the genotype CC in severe category of COVID-19. Interestingly, the TC genotype was also found to be positively associated with severe outcome (unadjusted OR-5.816 (1.489-22.709)), indicating association of C allele in imparting the risk of severe outcome.Interpretation The study provides strong evidence that the presence of C allele of SNP (rs479200) of the EGLN1 gene associates with severity in COVID-19 patients. Thus, the presence of C allele may be a risk factor for COVID-19 severity. This study opens new avenues towards risk assessment that include EGLN1 (rs479200) genotype testing and identifying patients with C allele who might be prioritized for critical care.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by intramural funding support from ICMR-NIMR, Delhi.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees (IECs), AIIMS, Raipur [1379/IEC-AIIMSRPR/2020] &amp; ICMR-NIMR, Delhi [PHB/NIMR/EC/2020/145].I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Importance The suitability of the currently recommended 5-day COVID-19 isolation period remains unclear in an Omicron-dominant landscape. Early data suggest high positivity via rapid antigen test beyond day 5, but evidence gaps remain regarding optimal isolation duration and the best use of limited RATs to exit isolation.Objective To determine the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who remain positive via RAT on isolation day 5+ and assess possible factors associated with isolation duration.Design We evaluated daily rapid antigen test case series data from 324 persons in a managed isolation program who initially tested positive between January 1 and February 11, 2022, an Omicron-dominant period. Arrival tests and twice-weekly screening were mandated. Positive persons isolated and began mandatory daily self-testing on day 5 until testing negative. Trained staff proctored exit testing.Setting A mid-sized university in the United States.Participants University students in isolation.Main Outcomes and Measures The percentage of persons remaining positive on isolation day 5 and each subsequent day. The association between possible prognostic factors and isolation duration as measured by event-time-ratios (ETR).Results We found 47% twice-weekly screeners and 26-28% less frequent screeners remained positive on day 5, with the percentage approximately halving each additional day. Having a negative test ≥ 10 days before diagnosis (ETR 0.85 (95% CI 0.75-0.96)) and prior infection &gt; 90 days (ETR 0.50 (95% CI 0.33-0.76)) were significantly associated with shorter isolation. Symptoms before or at diagnosis (ETR 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.25)) and receipt of 3 vaccine doses (ETR 1.20 (95% CI 1.04-1.39)) were significantly associated with prolonged isolation. However, these factors were associated with duration of isolation, not infection, and could reflect how early infections were detected.Conclusions and Relevance A high percentage of university students during an Omicron-dominant period remained positive after the currently recommended 5-day isolation, highlighting possible onward transmission risk. Persons diagnosed early in their infections or using symptom onset as their isolation start may particularly require longer isolations. Significant factors associated with isolation duration should be further explored to determine relationships with infection duration.Question What percentage of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons remain positive via rapid antigen test on days 5+ of isolation?Findings In this case series of 324 university students, 47% of twice-weekly screeners and 26-28% of less frequent screeners remained positive via rapid antigen on isolation day 5, with the percent still positive approximately halving with each subsequent day.Meaning While isolation duration decisions are complex, our study adds to growing evidence that a 5-day isolation may be 1-2 days too short to sufficiently reduce the onward transmission risk, particularly for those in dense settings or among vulnerable populations.Competing Interest StatementNDG is a paid consultant for Tempus Labs and the National Basketball Association and has received speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.

%X BACKGROUND Bebtelovimab is a potent, fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, with broad neutralizing activity to all currently known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including omicron variant lineages. Specialized developmental approaches accelerated the initiation of a clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bebtelovimab alone (BEB) or together with bamlanivimab (BAM) and etesevimab (ETE) delivered via slow intravenous push for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19.METHODS This portion of the phase 2, BLAZE-4 trial (J2X-MC-PYAH; NCT04634409) enrolled 714 patients (between May and July 2021) with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 within 3 days (≤3 days) of laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients at low risk for severe COVID-19 were randomized 1:1:1 (double-blinded) to placebo, BEB 175 mg, or BEB 175 mg+BAM 700 mg+ETE 1400 mg (BEB+BAM+ETE). Patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 were randomized 2:1 (open-label) to BEB or BEB+BAM+ETE, and a subsequent treatment arm enrolled patients to BEB+BAM+ETE using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated criteria for High-risk. All treatments were administered intravenously over ≥30 seconds (open-label BEB) or ≥6.5 minutes (all other treatment arms). For the placebo-controlled patients (termed Low-risk), the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with persistently high viral load (PHVL) (log viral load &gt;5.27) on Day 7. For the open-label patients (termed High-risk), the primary endpoint was safety. In nonclinical studies, SARS-CoV-2 isolates were tested using an endpoint neutralization assay to measure BEB’s inhibitory concentration greater than 99% (IC99).RESULTS Baseline viral sequencing data were available from 611 patients; 90.2% (n=551) aligned with a variant of interest or concern (WHO designation), with the majority infected with delta (49.8%) or alpha (28.6%) variants. Among the Low-risk patients, PHVL occurred in 19.8% of patients treated with placebo, as compared to 12.7% (p=0.132) of patients treated with BEB+BAM+ETE and 12.0% (p=0.097) of patients treated with BEB, a 36% and 40% relative risk reduction, respectively. Viral load-area under the curve analysis from baseline to Day 11 showed statistically signficant reductions for patients treated with BEB (p=0.006) and BEB+BAM+ETE (p=0.043) compared to patients who received placebo. Time to sustained symptom resolution was reduced by a median of 2 days for patients treated with BEB (6 days; p=0.003) and 1 day for patients treated with BEB+BAM+ETE (7 days; p=0.289) compared to placebo (8 days). The incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause deaths by day 29 were similar across treatment arms, as expected given the patients’ risk status (the Low risk cohorts had a Low risk of hospitalization, and High risk cohorts received only active therapy without placebo). Overall, safety results were consistent with previous studies investigating mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of patients with treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were 9.7% in Low-risk (n=37/380) and 14.7% in High-risk (n=48/326) patients treated with BEB or BEB+BAM+ETE; majority of AEs were considered mild or moderate in severity. Serious AEs were reported in 2.1% of High-risk patients (n=7/326), including one death (a cerebrovascular accident); 1 serious AE was reported among Low-risk patients. In an in vitro neutralization assay, BEB neutralized the omicron isolate (BA.1) with &lt;2.44ng/ml estimated IC99.CONCLUSIONS In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, treatment with BEB or BEB+BAM+ETE was associated with greater viral clearance, a reduction in time to sustained symptom resolution, and safety results consistent with mAbs that target SARS-CoV-2. Integration of clinical findings with in vitro neutralization of emerging viral variants offered a pragmatic framework for investigating the efficacy of a new antiviral mAb agent, as demonstrated by bebtelovimab.Competing Interest StatementMixed Competing Interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant has been supplanted in many countries by the BA.2 sub-lineage. BA.2 differs from BA.1 by about 21 mutations in its spike. Human anti-spike monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. However, the capacity of therapeutic mAbs to neutralize BA.1 and BA.2 remains poorly characterized. Here, we first compared the sensitivity of BA.1 and BA.2 to neutralization by 9 therapeutic mAbs. In contrast to BA.1, BA.2 was sensitive to Cilgavimab, partly inhibited by Imdevimab and resistant to Adintrevimab and Sotrovimab. Two combinations of mAbs, Ronapreve (Casirivimab + Imdevimab) and Evusheld (Cilgavimab + Tixagevimab), are indicated as a pre-exposure prophylaxis in immunocompromised persons at risk of severe disease. We analyzed sera from 29 such individuals, up to one month after administration of Ronapreve and/or Evusheld. After treatment, all individuals displayed elevated antibody levels in their sera and neutralized Delta with high titers. Ronapreve recipients did not neutralize BA.1 and weakly impaired BA.2. With Evusheld, neutralization of BA.1 and BA.2 was detected in 19 and 29 out of 29 patients, respectively. As compared to Delta, titers were more severely decreased against BA.1 (344-fold) than BA.2 (9-fold). We further report 4 breakthrough Omicron infections among the 29 participants. Therefore, BA.1 and BA.2 exhibit noticeable differences in their sensitivity to therapeutic mAbs. Anti-Omicron activity of Ronapreve, and to a lesser extent that of Evusheld, is reduced in patients’ sera, a phenomenon associated with decreased clinical efficacy.Competing Interest StatementT.B, C.P., H.M. and O.S. have a pending patent application for an anti-RBD mAb not used in this study (PCT/FR2021/070522).Funding StatementWork in OS lab is funded by Institut Pasteur, Urgence COVID-19 Fundraising Campaign of Institut Pasteur, Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM), ANRS, the Vaccine Research Institute (ANR-10-LABX-77), Labex IBEID (ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID), ANR/FRM Flash Covid PROTEO-SARS-CoV-2, ANR Coronamito, and IDISCOVR.

%X As a novel approach we will combine trajectories or longitudinal studies of gene expression with information on annual influenza epidemics. Seasonality of gene expression in immune cells from blood could be a consequence of within-host seasonal immunity interacting with the seasonal pandemics of influenza (flu) in temperate regions and, thus, with potential valuable analogy transfer to the proposed seasonal development of covid-19.Here we operationalized within-host immunity as genes with both a significant seasonal term and a significant flu term in the sine-cosine model. Information on gene expression was based on microarray using RNase buffered blood samples collected randomly from a population-based cohort of Norwegian middle-aged women in 2003-2006, The Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study. The unique discovery (N=425) and replication (N=432) design were based on identical sampling and preprocessing. Data on proportion of sick leaves due to flu, and the flu intensities per week was obtained from the National Institute of Public Health, giving a semi-ecological analysis.The discovery analysis found 2942 (48.1%) significant genes in a generalized seasonal model over four years. For 1051 within-host genes both the seasonal and the flu term were significant. These genes followed closely the flu intensities. The trajectories showed slightly more genes with a maximum in early winter than in late summer. Moving the flu intensity forward in time indicated a better fit 3-4 weeks before the observed influenza. In the replication analyses, 369 genes (35.1% of 1051) were significant. Exclusion of genes with unknown functions and with more than a season in difference reduced the number of genes in the discovery dataset to 305, illustrating the variability in the measurements and the problem in assessing weak biological relationships. Thus, we found for the first time a clear seasonality in gene expression with marked responses to the annual seasonal influenza in a unique discovery – replication design. Hypothetically, this could support the within-host seasonal immunity concept.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by a grant given to Eiliv Lund from the European Research Council (ERC-AdG 232997 TICE), and a donation from Halfdan Jacobsen og frues legat (The Norwegian Cancer Society).

%X The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with immune escape ability raises the urgent need for developing cross-neutralizing vaccines against the virus. NVSI-06-08 is a potential broad-spectrum recombinant COVID-19 vaccine that integrates the antigens from multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains into a single immunogen. Here, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of NVSI-06-08 as a heterologous booster dose in adults previously vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV in a randomized, double-blind, controlled, phase 2 trial conducted in the United Arab Emirates (NCT05069129). Three groups of healthy adults over 18 years of age (600 participants per group) who had administered two doses of BBIBP-CorV 4-6-month, 7-9-month and &gt;9-month earlier, respectively, were vaccinated with either a homologous booster of BBIBP-CorV or a heterologous booster of NVSI-06-08. The primary outcome was immunogenicity and safety of booster vaccinations. The exploratory outcome was cross-reactive immunogenicity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VOCs). The incidence of adverse reactions was low in both booster vaccinations, and the overall safety profile of heterologous boost was quite similar to that of homologous boost. Heterologous NVSI-06-08 booster was immunogenically superior to homologous booster of BBIBP-CorV. Both Neutralizing and IgG antibodies elicited by NVSI-06-08 booster were significantly higher than by the booster of BBIBP-CorV against not only SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain but also multiple VOCs. Especially, the neutralizing activity induced by NVSI-06-08 booster against the immune-evasive Beta variant was no less than that against the prototype strain, and a considerable level of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron (GMT: 367.67; 95%CI, 295.50-457.47) was induced by heterologous booster, which was substantially higher than that boosted by BBIBP-CorV (GMT: 45.03; 95%CI, 36.37-55.74). Our findings showed that NVSI-06-08 was safe and immunogenic as a booster dose following two doses of BBIBP-CorV, which was immunogenically superior to homologous boost with another dose of BBIBP-CorV. Our study also indicated that the design of hybrid antigen may provide an effective strategy for broad-spectrum vaccine developments.Competing Interest StatementY.K.Y., T.Y., M.L., X.Z., C.Q., D.Y.L., Z.N.W., J.L.Y., L.Q., Y.T.Z. and X.M.Y. are employees of the China National Biotec Group Company Limited.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has become the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant around the world and exhibits immune escape to current COVID-19 vaccines to some extent due to its numerous spike mutations. Here, we evaluated the immune responses to booster vaccination with intramuscular adenovirus-vectored vaccine (Ad5-nCoV), aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, a recombinant protein subunit vaccine (ZF2001) or homologous inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac) in those who received two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines 6 months prior. We found that the Ad5-nCoV booster induced potent neutralizing activity against the wild-type virus and Omicron variant, while aerosolized Ad5-nCoV generated the greatest neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron variant at day 28 after booster vaccination, at 14.1-fold that of CoronaVac, 5.6-fold that of ZF2001 and 2.0-fold that of intramuscular Ad5-nCoV. Similarly, the aerosolized Ad5-nCoV booster produced the greatest IFNγ T-cell response at day 14 after booster vaccination. The IFNγ T-cell response to aerosolized Ad5-nCoV was 12.8-fold for CoronaVac, 16.5-fold for ZF2001, and 5.0-fold for intramuscular Ad5-nCoV. Aerosolized Ad5-nCoV booster also produced the greatest spike-specific B cell response. Our findings suggest that inactivated vaccine recipients should consider adenovirus-vectored vaccine boosters in China and that aerosolized Ad5-nCoV may provide a more efficient alternative in response to the spread of the Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementTao Zhu is the employee of CanSino Biologics and has stock options in CanSino Biologics.

%T HAT-field: a cheap, robust and quantitative point-of-care serological test for Covid-19

%X We have recently described a very simple and cheap serological test called HAT to detect antibodies directed against the RBD of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. HAT is based on hemagglutination, triggered by a single reagent (IH4-RBD) comprised of the viral RBD domain fused to a nanobody specific for glycophorin, which is expressed at very high levels at the surface of human red blood cells (RBCs).One of the main initial goals of this study was to devise a test protocol that would be sensitive and reliable, yet require no specialized laboratory equipment such as adjustable pipets, so that it could be performed in the most remote corners of the world by people with minimal levels of training. Because antibody levels against the viral RBD have been found to correlate closely with sero-neutralisation titers, and thus with protection against reinfection, it has become obvious during the course of this study that making this test reliably quantitative would be a further significant advantage.Using IH4-RBD based on the original Wuhan sequence, we have found that, in PBN, a buffer which contains BSA and sodium azide, the reagent is stable for over 6 months at room temperature, and that PBN also improves HAT performance compared to using straight PBS. We also show that performing HAT at either 4°C, room temperature or 37°C has minimal influence on the results, and that quantitative evaluation of the levels of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can be achieved in a single step using titration of the IH4-RBD reagent.The HAT-field protocol described here requires only very simple disposable equipment and a few microliters of whole blood, such as can be obtained by finger prick. Because it is based on a single soluble reagent, the test can be adapted very simply and rapidly to detect antibodies against variants of the SARS-CoV-2, or conceivably against different pathogens. HAT-field appears well suited to provide quantitative assessments of the serological protection of populations as well as individuals, and given its very low cost, the stability of the IH4-RBD reagent in the adapted buffer, and the simplicity of the procedure, could be deployed pretty much anywhere, including in the poorest countries and the most remote corners of the globe.Note: This manuscript has been refereed by Review Commons, and modified thanks to the comments and suggestions from three referees.

%X The CDC recommended a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (BNT162b2) COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in September 2021 for high-risk individuals. Pregnant and high-risk lactating women were encouraged to receive the booster to obtain potential prolonged protection for themselves and their infants. This study investigated the ability of the booster vaccine to increase IgA and IgG antibodies specific to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human milk compared to levels pre-booster. We found a significant increase in both anti-RBD-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in human milk 1-2 weeks after the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and at the study endpoint (60 days post-booster). These results suggest the booster vaccination enhances SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity in human breast milk, which may be protective for infants.Key PointsAbs to SARS-COV-2 RBD are detected in blood ≥60 days post-Pfizer-BioNTech booster.Human milk Abs to SARS-COV-2 RBD are higher ≥60 days post-booster vs pre-booster.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any external funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Institutional Review Board of Carthage College gave ethical approval for this work (IRB# 1817816-1).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The scale and duration of neutralizing antibody responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral variants represents a critically important serological parameter that predicts protective immunity for COVID-19. In this study, we present longitudinal data illustrating the impact of age, sex and comorbidities on the kinetics and strength of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses for key variants in an Asian volunteer cohort. We demonstrate a reduction in neutralizing antibody titres across all groups six months post-vaccination and show a marked reduction in the serological binding and neutralizing response targeting Omicron compared to other viral variants. We also highlight the increase in cross-protective neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron induced by a third dose (booster) of vaccine. These data illustrate how key virological factors such as immune escape mutation combined with host factors such as age and sex of the vaccinated individuals influence the strength and duration of cross-protective serological immunity for COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Biomedical Research Council (BMRC), A*CRUSE (Vaccine monitoring project), the A*ccelerate GAP-funded project (ACCL/19-GAP064-R20H-H) from Agency of Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore National Medical Research Council COVID-19 Research Fund (COVID19RF-001; COVID19RF-007; COVID19RF-0008; COVID19RF-060) and A*STAR COVID-19 Research funding (H/20/04/g1/006).

%X The high number of mutations in the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 cause its immune escape when compared to the earlier variants of concern (VOC). At least three vaccine doses are required for the induction of Omicron neutralizing antibodies and further reducing the risk for hospitalization. However, most of the studies have focused on the immediate response after the booster vaccination while the duration of immune response is less known. We here studied longitudinal serum samples from the vaccinated individuals up to three months after their third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine for their capacity to produce protective antibodies and T cell responses to Wuhan and Omicron variants. After the second dose, the antibody levels to the unmutated spike protein were significantly decreased at three months, and only 4% of the individuals were able to inhibit Omicron spike interaction compared to 47%, 38%, and 14% of individuals inhibiting wild-type, delta, and beta variants’ spike protein. Nine months after the second vaccination, the antibody levels were similar to the levels before the first dose and none of the sera inhibited SARS-CoV-2 wild-type or any of the three VOCs. The booster dose remarkably increased antibody levels and their ability to inhibit all variants. Three months after the booster the antibody levels and the inhibition activity were trending lower but still up and not significantly different from their peak values at two weeks after the third dose. Although responsiveness towards mutated spike peptides was lost in less than 20 % of vaccinated individuals, the wild-type spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells were still present at three months after the booster vaccination in the majority of studied individuals. Our data show that two doses of the BNT62b2 vaccine are not sufficient to protect against the Omicron variant, however, the spike-specific antibodies and T cell responses are strongly elicited and well maintained three months after the third vaccination dose.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was supported by The Centre of Excellence for Genomics and Translational Medicine funded by EU European Regional Development Fund (Project No.2014-2020.4.01.15-0012), and the Estonian Research Council grant PRG377, PRG1117, Icosagen Cell Factory, and SYNLAB Estonia.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu on February 15, 2021 (No 335/T-21).

%X We studied a unique case of prolonged viral shedding in an immunocompromised patient that generated a series of SARS-CoV-2 immune escape mutations over a period of seven months. During the persisting SARS-CoV-2 infection seventeen non-synonymous mutations were observed, thirteen (13/17; 76.5%) of which occurred in the genomic region coding for spike. Fifteen (15/17; 88.2%) of these mutations have already been described in the context of variants of concern and include the prominent immune escape mutations S:E484K, S:D950N, S:P681H, S:N501Y, S:del(9), N:S235F and S:H655Y. Fifty percent of all mutations acquired by the investigated strain (11/22) are found in similar form in the Omicron variant of concern. The study shows the chronology of the evolution of intra-host mutations, which can be seen as the straight mutational response of the virus to specific antibodies and should therefore be given special attention in the rating of immune escape mutations of SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), Grant No. 889135.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval to use residual routinely taken serum samples for retrospective analyses was obtained by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Wuerzburg (no. 20201105_01).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Importance Recent CDC COVID-19 isolation guidance for non-immunocompromised individuals with asymptomatic or mild infection allows ending isolation after 5 days if asymptomatic or afebrile with improving symptoms. The role of rapid antigen testing in further characterizing the risk of viral transmission to others is unclear.Objective Understand rates of rapid antigen test (RAT) positivity after day 5 from a positive COVID-19 test and the relationship of this result to symptoms and viral culture.Design In this single center, observational cohort study, ambulatory individuals newly testing SARS-CoV-2 positive completed daily symptom logs, and RAT self-testing starting day 6 until negative. Anterior nasal and oral swabs were collected on a subset for viral culture.Main Outcomes and Measures Day 6 SARS-CoV-2 RAT result, symptoms and viral culture.Results 40 individuals enrolled between January 5 and February 11, 2022 with a mean age of 32 years (range 22 to 57). 23 (58%) were women and 17 (42%) men. All were vaccinated. 33 (83%) were symptomatic. Ten (25%) tested RAT negative on day 6. 61 of 90 (68%) RATs performed on asymptomatic individuals after day 5 were positive. Day 6 viral cultures were positive in 6 (35%) of 17 individuals. A negative RAT or being asymptomatic on day 6 were 100% and 78% predictive respectively for negative culture, while improving symptoms was 69% predictive. A positive RAT was 50% predictive of positive culture.Conclusion and Relevance RATs are suboptimal in predicting viral culture results on day 6. Use of routine RATs to guide end of COVID-19 isolation could result in significant numbers of culture negative, potentially non-infectious individuals undergoing prolonged isolation. However, a negative RAT was highly predictive of being culture negative. Complete absence of symptoms was inferior to a negative RAT in predicting a negative culture result, but performed better than improving symptoms. If a positive viral culture is a proxy for infectiousness, these data may help further refine a safer strategy for ending isolation.Competing Interest StatementD.T.H. is a founder, consultant to, equity holder in, and inventor of technology licensed to Sherlock Biosciences and serves on the Scientific Advisory Board for Proof Diagnostics, both infectious disease diagnostic companies.

%X We evaluated the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of heterologous COVID-19 primary series vaccination schedules. Participants were randomized to one of seven groups that received two-dose homologous BNT162b2 or heterologous combinations of CoronaVac, ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2, with 4 weeks interval. Of 210 participants, median age was 38 (19-60) years, 51% were female. The groups that received BNT162b2 as second dose induced the highest virus-specific IgG response against the ancestral strain [BNT162b2: geometric mean concentration (GMC) 2133-2249, 95%CI 1558 to 3055; ChAdOx1: 851-1201, 95%CI 649 to 1522; CoronaVac: 137-225, 95%CI 103-286 BAU/mL], neutralising antibodies (NAb) against Beta and Delta, and interferon gamma response. All groups induced low to negligible NAb against Omicron. A BNT162b2 booster (3rd dose) following heterologous CoronaVac and ChAdOx1 regimens induced &gt;140-fold increase in NAb titres against Omicron. Our findings indicate that heterologous regimens using BNT162b2 as the second dose may be considered an alternative schedule to maximize immune response.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Trialhttp://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/show/TCTR20210720007Funding StatementThis study was granted by the National Research Council of Thailand (N35A640368).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The clinical study was approved by the Siriraj Institutional Ethics Review Board (approval no.Si537/2021).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The testing of saliva samples for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA has become a useful and common method to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). However, there are limited examples of serial testing with correlated clinical metadata, especially in the outpatient setting.Method We developed a method to collect serial saliva samples on ordinary white printer paper, which can be subsequently analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using established polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures. The collection systems consisted of a biological diary (CoronaCal) where subjects dab their saliva onto ovals printed onto paper. The dried samples are covered with a sticker that includes a symptom checklist to create a biological diary. Each sheet of letter paper can accommodate up to 14 serial samples.Results In a pilot study, ten subjects used CoronaCals for durations of nine to 44 days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted and detected in CoronaCals from nine of nine people with either Covid-19 symptoms or exposure to someone with Covid-19, and in zero of one asymptomatic person. The CoronaCals were stored for up to 70 days at room temperature during collection and then frozen for up to four months before analysis, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is stable once dried onto paper. Interestingly, the temporal pattern of symptoms was not well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serial daily collections for up to 44 days. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was discontinuous over time in most cases but persisted for up to 24 days.Conclusions We conclude that sampling of saliva on simple paper CoronaCals may provide a useful method to study the natural history and epidemiology of Covid-19. The CoronaCal collection and testing method we developed is also easy to implement, inexpensive, non-invasive, and scalable. More broadly, the approach can be used to archive biological samples for retrospective analysis to deepen epidemiological understanding during viral disease outbreaks and to provide information about the natural history of emerging infections.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was funded by the Richard Lounsbery Foundation and The Rockefeller University.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The protocol for the collection of the biological diaries described in this study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Rockefeller University and was deemed not to be human-subjects research.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Dysregulation in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and degradation may play a role in the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19; however, its role in the pediatric manifestations of this disease including MIS-C and chilblain-like lesions (CLL), otherwise known as “COVID toes”, remains unclear. Studying multinational cohorts, we found that, in CLL, NETs were significantly increased in serum and skin. There was geographic variability in the prevalence of increased NETs in MIS-C, in association with disease severity. MIS-C and CLL serum samples displayed decreased NET degradation ability, in association with C1q and G-actin or anti-NET antibodies, respectively, but not with genetic variants of DNases. In adult COVID-19, persistent elevations in NETs post-disease diagnosis were detected but did not occur in asymptomatic infection. COVID-19-affected adults displayed significant prevalence of impaired NET degradation, in association with anti-DNase1L3, G-actin, and specific disease manifestations, but not with genetic variants of DNases. NETs were detected in many organs of adult patients who died from COVID-19 complications. Infection with the Omicron variant was associated with decreased levels of NETs when compared to other SARS-CoV-2 strains. These data support a role for NETs in the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19 in pediatric and adult patients.Summary NET formation and degradation are dysregulated in pediatric and symptomatic adult patients with various complications of COVID-19, in association with disease severity. NET degradation impairments are multifactorial and associated with natural inhibitors of DNase 1, G-actin and anti-DNase1L3 and anti-NET antibodies. Infection with the Omicron variant is associated with decreased levels of NETs when compared to other SARS-CoV-2 strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSupported by the Intramural Research Program at NIAMS/ (ZIAAR041199 to MJK), NIAID (ZIA AI001270-01 to LDN and ZIAAI001265 to HCS), NIDCR (ZIADE000747 to JM),the Wisconsin Partnership Program 2020 Strategic COVID-19 Grant (to LA), FONDECYT 11181222 (to MCP), ANID 0999 (to MCV and MCP), and Regione Lombardia.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All individuals were enrolled in protocols approved by local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs: Comite Etico Cientifico Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile (protocol 2020-41); Comitato Etico Interaziendale A.O.U.

%X The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a serious healthcare problem worldwide since December 2019. The third dose of heterologous vaccine was recently approved by World Health Organization. The present study compared the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the reduced and standard third booster dose of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine in adults who previously received the two-dose CoronaVac vaccine. Results showed that headache, joint pain, and diarrhea were more frequent in the 15 μg-than the 30 μg-BNT162b2 groups, whereas joint pain and chilling were more frequent in the 100 μg-than the 50 μg-mRNA-1273 groups. No significant differences in immunogenicity were detected. These findings demonstrate that the reduced dose of the mRNA vaccines elicited antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants that were comparable to the standard dose. The reduced dose could be used to increase vaccine coverage in situations of limited global vaccine supply.HighlightsThe 15 μg- and 30 μg-BNT162b2, and 50 μg- and 100 μg-mRNA-1273 booster doses were comparedBooster vaccination with the mRNA vaccine elicits high Ig and IgG anti-RBD in CoronaVac-vaccinated adultsNo differences were observed in antibody responses after the reduced or standard booster dose of the mRNA vaccine in CoronaVac-vaccinated adultsNeutralizing antibodies against the delta and omicron variants were significantly higher after the booster doseNeutralizing antibody titers were lower against the omicron variant than the delta variant in all vaccinated adultsCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThis trial was included on the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR 20210910002).Funding StatementThis research was financially supported by Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI), National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Chulalongkorn University, and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, and partially supported by the Second Century Fund (C2F) of Sitthichai Kanokudom, Chulalongkorn University.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (IRB number 690/64).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The emergence of Omicron and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 has begun a number of discussions regarding breakthrough infection, waning immunity, need and timing for vaccine boosters and whether existing mRNA vaccines for the wildtype strain are adequate. Our work leverages a biosensor-based technique to evaluate the binding efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific salivary antibodies to the Omicron and Delta variants using a cohort of mRNA vaccinated (n=109) and convalescent (n=19) subjects. We discovered a wide range of binding efficacies to the variant strains, with a mean reduction of 60.5%, 26.7%, and 14.7% in measurable signal to the Omicron strain and 13.4%, 2.4%, and −6.4% percent mean reduction to the Delta Variant for convalescent, Pfizer, and Moderna vaccinated groups respectively. This assay may be an important tool in determining susceptibility to infection or need for booster immunization as the pandemic evolves.Key PointsAMPERIAL assay developed to quantify salivary SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibodies to Omicron and Delta variantsThere was a reduction in affinity to both Delta and Omicron VariantsThe reduction in affinity was more pronounced to Omicron than for Delta VariantsThere was a significant difference between IgG affinities in Individuals vaccinated with Pfizer versus Moderna VaccinesCompeting Interest StatementD.

%X Virus neutralizing antibody (vnAb) titers are the strongest laboratory correlate of protection from SARS-CoV-2. Providing individuals with real-time measures of their vnAb titers is predicted to improve their ability to make personal wellness decisions. Yet, widespread commercial testing of SARS-CoV-2 vnAbs does not currently occur. Here, we examined whether knowing their vnAb titer impacted wellness decision-making among individuals. To this end, starting on January 1, 2021, we offered all employees from two companies free IMMUNO-COV™ testing and conducted a survey to assess their behaviors and decisions regarding booster vaccination. IMMUNO-COV is a clinically validated, surrogate virus assay that quantitates serum titers of SARS-CoV-2 vnAbs. To help participants gauge their level of protection based on their vnAb titer, we calibrated IMMUNO-COV titers to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard (IU/mL), making them comparable to published reports of correlates of protection, and we fit historical IMMUNO-COV vnAb titer values into predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19. As expected, data for the 56 program participants showed variability in vnAb titers post vaccination, rates vnAb decay, and fold-increases in vnAb titers after booster vaccination. Based on the participant survey, the majority (66%) of participants indicated that knowing their vnAb titer impacted their social behaviors and/or their decision on the timing of a booster vaccination. Several participants indicated that knowing their vnAb titer contributed to their peace of mind regarding their high level of protection from COVID-19. Together, these data demonstrate that regular determination of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers can significantly impact decisions regarding social interactions and timing of booster vaccinations.Competing Interest StatementAuthors have a financial interest due to equity in Imanis Life Sciences (Mayo Clinic, SJR, KWP) and Vyriad (SJR, KWP, SN), or are employees of Imanis Life Sciences or Vyriad.Funding StatementThis study was funded internally Vyriad, Inc. and Imanis Life Sciences.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol, informed consent forms to collect blood, and participant survey were reviewed and approved by Western Institutional Review Board.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection, including incubation period and transmission rates, distinguish this variant from preceding variants. However, whether the duration of shedding of viable virus differs between omicron and previous variants is not well understood. To characterize how variant and vaccination status impact shedding of viable virus, we serially sampled symptomatic outpatients newly diagnosed with COVID-19. Anterior nasal swabs were tested for viral load, sequencing, and viral culture. Time to PCR conversion was similar between individuals infected with the Delta and the Omicron variant. Time to culture conversion was also similar, with a median time to culture conversion of 6 days (interquartile range 4-8 days) in both groups. There were also no differences in time to PCR or culture conversion by vaccination status.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness (grants to J.Z.L, J.E.L, M.B.G., M.J.S, and A.K.B.) and the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Medicine (grant to J.M.V.).

%X Rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals through viral RNA detection followed by effective personal isolation remains the most effective way to prevent the spread of this virus. Large-scale RNA detection involves mass specimen collection and transportation. For biosafety reasons, denaturing viral transport medium has been extensively used during the pandemic. But the high concentrations of guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) in such media have raised issues around sufficient GITC supply and laboratory safety. Here, we tested whether supplementing media containing low concentrations of GITC with ammonium sulfate (AS) would affect the throat-swab detection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus or a viral inactivation assay targeting both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Adding AS to the denaturing transport media reduced the need for high levels of GITC and improved SARS-COV-2 RNA detection without compromising virus inactivation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (2018A030313252), the Shenzhen Science and Technology Project (JCYJ20190808122605563), the Shenzhen Peacock Plan and the Fundamental Research Funds for Shenzhen Technology University.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of Shenzhen Technology University waived ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X By the end of July 2021, the majority of the Icelandic population had received vaccination against COVID-19. In mid-July a wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, dominated by the delta variant, spread through the population, followed by an omicron wave in December. A booster vaccination campaign was initiated to curb the spread of the virus. We estimated the risk of infection for different vaccine combinations using vaccination data from 276,028 persons and 963,557 qPCR tests for 277,687 persons. We measured anti-Spike-RBD antibody levels and ACE2-Spike binding inhibitory activity in 371 persons who received one of four recommended vaccination schedules with or without an mRNA vaccine booster. Overall, we found different antibody levels and inhibitory activity between recommended vaccination schedules, which was reflected in the observed risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We observed an increased protection following mRNA boosters, against both omicron and delta variant infections, although BNT162b2 boosters provided greater protection against omicron than mRNA-1273 boosters.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the National Bioethics Committee of Iceland (approval no.

%X Continued waves, new variants, and limited vaccine deployment mean that SARS-CoV-2 tests remain vital to constrain the COVID-19 pandemic. Affordable, point-of-care (PoC) tests allow rapid screening in non-medical settings. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an appealing approach. A crucial step is to optimize testing in low/medium resource settings. Here, we optimized RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 and human β-actin, and tested clinical samples in multiple countries. “TTTT” linker primers did not improve performance, and while guanidine hydrochloride, betaine and/or Igepal-CA-630 enhanced detection of synthetic RNA, only the latter two improved direct assays on nasopharygeal samples. With extracted clinical RNA, a 20 min RT-LAMP assay was essentially as sensitive as RT-PCR. With raw Canadian nasopharygeal samples, sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 67.6% - 100%) for those with RT-qPCR Ct values ≤ 25, and 80% (95% CI: 58.4% - 91.9%) for those with 25 &lt; Ct ≤ 27.2. Highly infectious, high titer cases were also detected in Colombian and Ecuadorian labs. We further demonstrate the utility of replacing thermocyclers with a portable PoC device (FluoroPLUM). These combined PoC molecular and hardware tools may help to limit community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementConflict of interest: Y.G., S.C., and K.P. are co-inventors of the PLUM reader and co-founders of LSK Technologies, Inc.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Canada's International Development Research Center (RB, CG and KP, grant number: 109547-001) through the COVID-19 May 2020 Rapid Research Funding Opportunity, the Krembil Foundation (RB, grant number: Not applicable), and the University of Toronto COVID-19 Action Initiative 2020 (KP, grant number: Not applicable).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Research Ethics Boards of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The last year of Covid-19 pandemic has been characterized by the continuous chase between the vaccination campaign and the appearance of new variants that put further obstacles to the possibility of eradicating the virus and returning to normality in a short period. In the present paper we consider a deterministic compartmental model to discuss the evolution of the Covid-19 in Italy as a combined effect of vaccination campaign, new variant spreading, waning immunity and mobility restrictions. We analyze the role that different mechanisms, such as behavioral changes due to variable risk perception, variation of the population mobility, seasonal variability of the virus infectivity, and spreading of new variants have had in shaping the epidemiological curve. The fundamental impact of vaccines in drastically reducing the total increase in infections and deaths is also estimated. This work further underlines the crucial importance of vaccination and adoption of adequate individual protective measures in containing the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementA.L. and A.F. acknowledge financial support of the MIUR PRIN 2017WZFTZP ?Stochastic forecasting in complex systems?.

%X The number of mutations in the omicron (B1.1.529) BA.1 variant of concern (VOC) led to an unprecedented evasion of vaccine induced immunity. However, despite the remarkable rise in global infections, severe disease and death did not increase proportionally, linked to persistent recognition of BA.1 by T cells and non-neutralizing opsonophagocytic antibodies. Yet, the emergence of a new sublineage, BA.2, that is more transmissible compared to BA.1, despite relatively preserved neutralizing antibody responses, has raised the possibility that BA.2 may evade other vaccine induced responses that may be key to protection against infection and disease. Here we comprehensively profiled the BNT162b2 vaccine induced response to several VOCs including the omicron BA.1 and BA.2, after the primary vaccine series, 8 months following vaccination, and after a boost. While vaccine induced immune responses were compromised against both Omicron sublineages, vaccine induced antibody isotype titers, FcγR3a- and FcγR3b-receptor binding levels, and non-neutralizing opsonophagocytic functions were significantly attenuated to the omicron BA.2 Spike compared to the BA.1 lineage. Conversely, FcγR2a and FcγR2b binding was elevated to BA.2 potentially contributing to persistent protection against severity of disease. These data point to an attenuation of particular non-neutralizing antibody properties that may be key to protection against transmission, but the maintenance of others that may continue to confer protection against disease.Competing Interest StatementG.A. is a founder and equity holder of Seromyx Systems, a company developing a platform technology that describes the antibody immune response.

%X Background Limited information is available on the impact of immunosuppressants on COVID-19 vaccination in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID).Methods This observational cohort study examined the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic disease, with or without maintenance immunosuppressive therapies. Antibody and T cell responses to SARS-COV-2, including neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants were determined before and after 1 and 2 vaccine doses.Results We prospectively followed 150 subjects, 26 healthy controls, 9 IMID patients on no treatment, 44 on anti-TNF, 16 on anti-TNF with methotrexate/azathioprine (MTX/AZA), 10 on anti-IL-23, 28 on anti-IL-12/23, 9 on anti-IL-17, and 8 on MTX/AZA. Antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in all participants, increasing from dose 1 to dose 2 and declining 3 months later, with greater attrition in IMID patients compared to healthy controls. Antibody levels and neutralization efficacy against variants of concern were substantially lower in anti-TNF treated patients than in healthy controls and were undetectable against Omicron by 3 months after dose 2.Conclusions Our findings support the need for a third dose of mRNA vaccine and for continued monitoring of immunity in these patient groups.Funding Funded by a donation from Juan and Stefania Speck and by Canadian Institutes of Health (CIHR) /COVID-Immunity Task Force (CITF) grants VR-1 172711 and VS1-175545 (T.H.W. and A.C.G); CIHR FDN-143250 (T.H.W.), GA2-177716 (V.C., A.C.G., T.W.), GA1-177703 (A.C.G.) and the CIHR rapid response network to SARS-CoV-2 variants, CoVaRR-Net (to A.C.G.).Competing Interest StatementDr Inman has served as consultant for Abbvie, Janssen, Lilly, Novartis and has received research funding support from Abbvie and Novartis.

%X Objectives Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of contracting coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) than the general population. This study assessed the roles of various exposures and personal protective equipment (PPE) use on that risk for HCWs working in primary care, long-term-care facilities (LTCFs) or hospitals.Methods We conducted a matched case-control (1:1) study (10 April–9 July 2021). Cases (HCWs with confirmed COVID-19) and controls (HCWs without any COVID-19-positive test or symptoms) recruited by email were invited to complete an online questionnaire on their exposures and PPE use. Questions covered the 10 days preceding symptom onset for cases (or testing if asymptomatic) or inclusion for controls.Results A total of 4152 matched cases and controls were included. The multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis retained exposure to an infected person outside work (adjusted odds ratio, 19.9 [95% confidence intervaI, 12.4–31.9]), an infected colleague (2.26 [1.53–3.33]) or COVID-19 patients (2.37 [1.66–3.40]), as independent predictors of COVID-19 in HCWs, while partial or complete immunization was protective. Eye protection (0.57 [0.37–0.87]) and wearing a gown (0.58 [0.34–0.97]) during COVID-19 patient care were protective, while wearing an apron slightly increased the risk of infection (1.47 [1.00–2.18]). N95-respirator protection was comparable to that of surgical masks. Results were consistent across healthcare-facility categories.Conclusions HCWs were more likely to get COVID-19 in their personal sphere than during occupational activities. Our results suggest that eye protection for HCWs during patient care should be actively promoted.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was funded by Institut Pasteur and Research, Action Emerging Infectious Diseases (REACTing), and the French Agency ANRS- Maladies Infectieuses Emergentes (ComCor project).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Comite de Protection des Personnes (CPP) Sud Ouest et Outre Mer-1 waived ethical approval for this work Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes (CNIL) waived ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Multiple myeloma (MM) patients may have a reduced response to vaccination due to immunodeficiency. The humoral and cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA full vaccination and booster dose as well as the impact of spike variants, including the emerging Omicron one, are still unclear and have been investigated in this study in a cohort of MM patients and those with pre-malignant monoclonal gammopathies.Firstly, we have shown that MM patients with relapsed-refractory disease (MMR) had a reduced spike-specific antibody levels and neutralizing titers after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA full vaccination. Interestingly, all the analyzed variants, remarkably Omicron, had a significant negative impact on the neutralizing ability of the vaccine-induced antibodies in all patients with MM and in smoldering MM too. Moreover, lower spike-specific IL-2-producing CD4+ T cells and reduced cytotoxic spike-specific IFN-γ and TNF-α-producing-CD8+ T cells were found in MM patients as compared to MGUS.Finally, we found that booster immunization improved SARS-CoV-2 spike humoral and cellular responses in newly diagnosed MM (MMD) patients and in most, but not all, MMR patients. After the booster dose, a significant increase of the neutralizing antibody titers against almost all the analyzed variants was achieved in MMD. On the other hand, in MMR patients, Omicron retain a negative impact on neutralizing ability, suggesting these patients need to be considered still at risk of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection with a clinically relevant disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by funding from: AIRC under IG IG2017 ID. 20299 project and International Myeloma Society (IMS) under Paula and Rodeger Riney Foundation Translational Research Grant (PI Nicola Giuliani) and by the Associazione Italiana contro Leucemie, Linfomi e Mielomi ONLUS, ParmAIL.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Area Vasta Emilia Nord (AVEN) Ethics CommitteeI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X OBJECTIVES Antibody testing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been instrumental in detecting previous exposures and analyzing vaccine-elicited immune responses. Here, we describe a scalable solution to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, discriminate between natural infection- and vaccination-induced responses, and assess antibody-mediated inhibition of the spike-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction.METHODS We developed methods and reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The main assays focus on the parallel detection of immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against the spike trimer, its receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N). We automated a surrogate neutralization (sn)ELISA that measures inhibition of ACE2-spike or -RBD interactions by antibodies. The assays were calibrated to a World Health Organization reference standard.RESULTS Our single-point IgG-based ELISAs accurately distinguished non-infected and infected individuals. For seroprevalence assessment (in a non-vaccinated cohort), classifying a sample as positive if antibodies were detected for ≥ 2 of the 3 antigens provided the highest specificity. In vaccinated cohorts, increases in anti-spike and -RBD (but not -N) antibodies are observed. We present detailed protocols for serum/plasma or dried blood spots analysis performed manually and on automated platforms. The snELISA can be performed automatically at single points, increasing its scalability.CONCLUSIONS Measuring antibodies to three viral antigens and identify neutralizing antibodies capable of disrupting spike-ACE2 interactions in high-throughput enables large-scale analyses of humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. The reagents are available to enable scaling up of standardized serological assays, permitting inter-laboratory data comparison and aggregation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe acknowledge support from Ontario Together and funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR; #VR1-172711, GA1-177703 and #439999) and the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (CITF).

%X In this paper we report on genome sequencing of 154 SARS-CoV-2 samples between June and July 2021 (Summer outbreak) in the Bailiwick of Jersey, a UK channel island. We have analysed extensive data collected on 598,155 RT-qPCR tests that identified 8,950 positive cases as part of public health surveillance from September 2020 to August 2021. Our study implemented an amplicon-based sequencing approach using the Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) portable device. This revealed the emergence of twelve AY sublineages and were clustered into the Delta sub-clades 21I and 21J. This was integrated alongside an existing RT-qPCR diagnostic laboratory to provide a sample-to-sequence turnaround time of approximately 30 hours with significant scope for optimisation. Owing to the geographic remoteness of the island from large scale sequencing infrastructure, this presents an opportunity to provide policy makers with near real-time sequencing findings. Our analysis suggests that age and sex remained a substantial risk factor for mortality. We observe viral loads are higher in advanced ages and unvaccinated individuals. The median age of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals was higher during winter than the summer outbreak, and the contact tracing program showed that younger individuals stayed positive for longer.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Open Cell.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics Committee of Jersey General Hospital (Bailiwick of Jersey) gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Objective We investigated blood samples from fully SARS-CoV2-vaccinated subjects and from previously positive tested patients up to one year after infection with SARS-CoV2, and compared short- and long-term T cell and antibody responses, with a special focus on the recently emerged delta variant (B.1.617.2).Methods and Results In 23 vaccinated subjects, we documented high anti-SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titers. Average virus neutralization by antibodies, assessed as inhibition of ACE2 binding to RBD, was 2.2-fold reduced for delta mutant vs. wild type (wt) RBD. The mean specific antibody titers were lower one year after natural infection than after vaccination; ACE2 binding to delta mutant vs. wt RBD was 1.65-fold reduced. In an additional group, omicron RBD binding was reduced compared to delta.Specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured after stimulation with peptides pools from wt, alpha, beta, gamma, or delta variant SARS-CoV2 spike proteins by flow cytometric intracellular cytokine staining. There was no significant difference in cytokine production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2 between vaccinated subjects. T cell responses to wt or mutant SARS-CoV2 spike were significantly weaker after natural occurring infections compared to those in vaccinated individuals.Conclusion Antibody neutralisation of the delta mutant was reduced compared to wt, as assessed in a novel inhibition assay with a finger prick blood drop. Strong CD4 T cell responses were present against wt and mutant SARS-CoV2 variants, including the delta (B.1.617.2) strain, in fully vaccinated individuals, whereas they were partly weaker 1 year after natural infection. Hence, immune responses after vaccination are stronger compared to those after naturally occurring infection, pointing out the need of the vaccine to overcome the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementAll auithors are employees of ISAR Bioscience, a biotech companyFunding StatementBayrische Forschungsstiftung grant # 1438-2020Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This project was submitted for ethical review to and approved by the Bavarian Medical ChamberI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Introduction The vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 provides humoral immunity to fight COVID-19; however, the acquired immunity gradually declines. Booster vaccination restores reduced humoral immunity; however, its effect on newly emerging variants, such as the Omicron variant, is a concern. As the waves of COVID-19 cases and vaccine programs differ between countries, it is necessary to know the domestic effect of the booster.Methods Serum samples were obtained from healthcare workers (20-69 years old) in the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine program at the Toyama University Hospital 6 months after the second dose (6mA2D, n = 648) and 2 weeks after the third dose (2wA3D, n = 565). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level was measured, and neutralization against the wild-type and variants (Delta and Omicron) was evaluated using pseudotyped viruses. Data on booster-related events were collected using questionnaires.Results The median anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was &gt;30.9-fold elevated after the booster (6mA2D, 710.0 U/mL [interquartile range (IQR): 443.0–1068.0 U/mL]; 2wA3D, 21927 U/mL [IQR: 15321.0–&gt;25000.0 U/mL]). Median neutralizing activity using 100-fold sera against wild-type-, Delta-, and Omicron-derived variants was elevated from 84.6%, 36.2%, and 31.2% at 6mA2D to &gt;99.9%, 99.1%, and 94.6% at 2wA3D, respectively. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were significantly elevated in individuals with fever ≥37.5 °C, general fatigue, and myalgia, local swelling, and local hardness.Conclusion The booster effect, especially against the Omicron variant, was observed in the Japanese population. These findings contribute to the precise understanding of the efficacy and side effects of the booster and the promotion of vaccine campaigns.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases from the AMED (grant number JP20he0622035), the Research Funding Grant from the president of the University of Toyama, Morinomiyako Medical Research Foundation, and Kurozumi Medical Foundation.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of University of Toyama gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Vaccines are proven to be an effective tool in prophylaxis of severe COVID-19, but emerging mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants constantly challenge vaccines’ protectivity. We have evaluated the ability of the sera from individuals vaccinated with two variants of inactivated vaccine CoviVac and COVID-19 convalescents (May-December 2020) to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta and Omicron. Four groups of serum samples (CoviVac vaccinees; COVID-19 convalescents; mice immunized with CoviVac preparations based on prototype B.1.1 strain and Delta variant) were evaluated in virus neutralization test against SARS-CoV-2 heterologous B.1.1 virus, Delta and Omicron variants. CoviVac preparations based on B.1.1 and Delta induced neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1 and two variants of concern. We observed a decrease in neutralization capacity in the sera from CoviVac (based on B.1.1 strain) vaccinees: 57.1% samples had detectable neutralizing antibodies against Delta and 61.9% against Omicron variants. Sera samples of all (100%) mice immunized with a candidate vaccine based on the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant strain had neutralizing antibodies against all tested strains.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are employees of the Chumakov FSC R&amp;D IBP RAS (Institute of poliomyelitis) the developer and producer of the inactivated vaccine against coronavirus infection CoviVac.

%X Detection of early and reliable symptoms is important in relation to limiting the spread of an infectious disease. For COVID-19, the most prevalent symptom is either losing or experiencing reduced olfactory functions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that olfactory dysfunction is also one of the earlier symptoms of COVID-19 but objective measures supporting this notion are currently missing. To determine whether olfactory dysfunction is an early sign of COVID-19, we assessed available longitudinal data from a web-based interface enabling individuals to test their sense of smell by rating the intensity of selected household odors. Individuals continuously used the interface to assess their olfactory functions and at each login, in addition to odor ratings, recorded their symptoms and result from potential COVID-19 test. A total of 205 COVID-19 positive individuals and 156 pseudo-randomly matched control individuals lacking positive test provided longitudinal data which enabled us to assess olfactory functions in relation to their test results date. We found that odor intensity ratings started to decline in the COVID-19 group as early as 6 days prior to test result date. Symptoms such as sore throat, aches, and runny nose appear around the same point in time; however, with a lower predictability of a COVID-19 diagnose. Our results suggest that olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom but does not appear before other related COVID-19 symptoms. Olfactory dysfunction is, however, more predictive of an COVID-19 diagnose than other early symptoms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding provided by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW 2018.0152), the Swedish Research Council (2021-06527), and a donation from Stiftelsen Bygg-Gota for Vetenskaplig forskning.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by both the Israeli Edith Wolfson Medical Centre Helsinki Committee and the Swedish Institutional Review Board (Etikprovningsnamnden).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Importance Response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) is severely reduced. Heterologous 3rd vaccination combining mRNA and vector vaccines did not increase seroconversion at four weeks after vaccination but evolution of antibody levels beyond the first month remain unknown.Objective To assess changes in antibody response following a 3rd vaccination with mRNA or vector vaccine in KTR from month one to month three after vaccination.Design, Setting and Participants Three-month follow-up (pre-specified secondary endpoint) of a single-center, single-blinded, 1:1 randomized, controlled trial on 3rd vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in 201 KTR who did not develop SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies following two doses of an mRNA vaccine.Intervention(s) mRNA (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) or vector (Ad26COVS1) as 3rd SARS-CoV-2 vaccineMain Outcomes and Measures Main outcome was seroconversion at the second follow-up between 60-120 days after the 3rd vaccination. Subsequently, higher cut-off levels associated with neutralizing capacity and protective immunity were applied (i.e. &gt;15, &gt;100, &gt;141 and &gt;264 BAU/mL). In addition, trajectories of antibody levels from month one to month three were analyzed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells at four weeks were compared among the 18 top responders in both groups.Results A total of 169 patients were available for the three-month follow-up. Overall, seroconversion at three months was similar between both groups (45% versus 50% for mRNA and vector group, respectively; OR=1.24, 95%CI=[0.65, 2.37], p=0.539). However, when applying higher cut-off levels, a significantly larger number of individual in the vector group reached antibody levels &gt; 141 and &gt; 264 BAU/mL at the three-month follow-up (141 BAU/mL: 4% vs. 15% OR=4.96, 95%CI=[1.29, 28.21], p=0.009 and 264 BAU/mL: 1% vs. 10% OR=8.75, 95%CI=[1.13, 396.17], p=0.018 for mRNA vs. vector vaccine group, respectively). In line, antibody levels in seroconverted patients further increased from month one to month three in the vector group while remaining unchanged in the mRNA group (median increase: mRNA= 1.35 U/mL and vector = 27.6 U/mL, p = 0.004). Of particular note, there was no difference in the CD4 and CD8 T-cell response between the mRNA and vector vaccine group at month one.Conclusions and Relevance Despite a similar overall seroconversion rate at three months following 3rd vaccination in KTR, a heterologous 3rd booster vaccination with Ad26COVS1 resulted in significantly higher antibody levels in responders.Trial Registration EurdraCT: 2021-002927-39Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialEurdraCT: 2021-002927-39Funding StatementMedical-Scientific Fund of the Mayor of Vienna, the Christine Vranitzky-Stiftung research grant 2020 (both to Roman Reindl-Schwaighofer) and the Transplantation Research Platform's Start-Up Grant 2020 (to Andreas Heinzel)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Patients undergoing immune-modifying therapies demonstrate a reduced humoral response after COVID-19 vaccination, but we lack a proper evaluation of the impact of such therapies on vaccine-induced T cell responses. Here, we longitudinally characterised humoral and Spike-specific T cell responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients who are on antimetabolite therapy (azathioprine or methotrexate), TNF inhibitors and/or other biologic treatment (anti-integrin or anti-p40) after mRNA vaccination up to 3 months after completing two vaccine doses. We demonstrated that a Spike-specific T cell response is not only induced in treated IBD patients at levels similar to healthy individuals, but also sustained at higher magnitude, particularly in those treated with TNF inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, the Spike-specific T cell response in these patients is mainly preserved against mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) and characterized by a Th1/IL-10 cytokine profile. Thus, despite the humoral response defects, the favourable profile of vaccine-induced T cell responses might still provide a layer of COVID-19 protection to patients under immune-modifying therapies.Competing Interest StatementN.

%X Aim The New Zealand government has transitioned from the Alert Level framework, which relied on government action and population level controls, to the COVID-19 Protection Framework, which relies on vaccination rates and allows for greater freedoms (for the vaccinated). Under the COVID-19 Protection Framework and current widespread community transmission of Omicron, there is significant interest in understanding the relative risk of spreading COVID-19 posed by unvaccinated, vaccinated, and boosted individuals.Methods A stochastic branching process model is used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 for outbreaks seeded by unvaccinated, vaccinated, or boosted individuals. The likelihood of infecting or getting infected with COVID-19 is calculated based on vaccination status. The model is applied to both the Delta and Omicron variants.Results For the Delta variant a vaccinated traveler infected with COVID-19 is 9x less likely to seed an outbreak than an unvaccinated traveler infected with COVID-19, however, for the Omicron variant there is little difference between outbreaks seeded by unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals (boosted individuals are slightly less likely to seed large outbreaks). For the Delta variant unvaccinated individuals are responsible for 87% of all infections whereas only 3% of infections are from vaccinated to vaccinated when normalized by population. Therefore, a vaccinated individual is 6.8x more likely to be infected by an unvaccinated individual than by a vaccinated individual. For the Omicron variant unvaccinated individuals are responsible for 45% of all infections compared to 39% for vaccinated (two-doses) and 15% for boosted (three-doses) individuals when normalized by population. Despite the vaccine being less effective at preventing breakthrough transmission for Omicron, only 3% of all infections are from boosted to boosted individuals when normalized by population indicating that three doses of the vaccine provide good protection from infection and breakthrough transmission.Conclusions This work demonstrates that most new infections are caused by unvaccinated individuals, especially for the Delta variant. These simulations illustrate the importance of vaccination in stopping individuals from becoming infected with COVID-19 and in preventing onward transmission. For Omicron, individuals vaccinated with two doses are only slightly less likely to spread COVID-19 than those who are unvaccinated. This work suggests that for the current Omicron outbreak the COVID-19 Protection Framework should potentially be updated to distinguish between those who have received two primary doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (vaccinated individuals) and those who have received three doses (boosted individuals).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), a passive polyclonal antibody therapeutic, has exhibited mixed results in the treatment of COVID-19. Given that the therapeutic effect of CCP may extend beyond the ability of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody binding and neutralization to influence the evolution of the endogenous antibody response, we took a systematic and comprehensive approach to analyze SARS-CoV-2 functional antibody profiles of participants in a randomized controlled trial of CCP treatment of individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia where CCP was associated with both decreased mortality and improved clinical severity. Using systems serology, we found that the clinical benefit of CCP is related to a shift towards reduced inflammatory Spike (S) responses and enhanced Nucleocapsid (N) humoral responses. We found CCP had the greatest clinical benefit in participants with low pre-existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody function, rather than S or N antibody levels or participant demographic features. Further, CCP induced immunomodulatory changes to recipient humoral profiles persisted for at least two months, marked by the selective evolution of anti-inflammatory Fc-glycan profiles and persistently expanded nucleocapsid-specific humoral immunity following CCP therapy. Together, our findings identify a novel mechanism of action of CCP, suggest optimal patient characteristics for CCP treatment, identify long-last immunomodulatory effects of CCP, and provide guidance for development of novel N-focused antibody therapeutics for severe COVID-19 hyperinflammation.Competing Interest StatementG.

%X Background Multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been evaluated in clinical trials, but very few include the pediatric population. The inactivated vaccine CoronaVac® has shown to be safe and immunogenic in a phase 1/2 clinical trial in a pediatric cohort in China. This study is an interim safety and immunogenicity report of a phase 3 clinical trial for CoronaVac® in healthy children and adolescents in Chile.Methods Participants aged 3 to 17 years old received two doses of CoronaVac® in a four-week interval. Local and systemic adverse reactions were registered in 699 participants that received the first dose and 381 that received the second dose until December 31st, 2021. Whole blood samples were collected from 148 participants for humoral and cellular immunity analyses.Results The primary adverse reaction reported after the first and second dose was pain at the injection site. The adverse reactions observed were primarily mild and local, and no severe adverse events were reported. Four weeks after the second dose, a significant increase in the levels of total and neutralizing antibodies was observed. Increased activation of specific CD4+ T cells was also observed four weeks after the second dose. Although antibodies induced by vaccination neutralize variants Delta and Omicron, titers were lower than the D614G variant. Importantly, comparable T cell responses were detected against these variants of concern.Conclusions CoronaVac® is safe and immunogenic in subjects aged 3-17 years old and is thus likely to confer protection against infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants in this target population.Competing Interest StatementXM and QQX are SINOVAC Biotech employees and contributed to the conceptualization of the study and did not participate in the analysis or interpretation of the data presented in the manuscript.

%X Background Third COVID-19 vaccine doses are broadly recommended, but immunogenicity data remain limited, particularly in older adults.Methods We measured circulating antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain, ACE2 displacement, and virus neutralization against ancestral and Omicron (BA.1) strains from pre-vaccine up to one month following the third dose, in 151 adults aged 24-98 years who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.Results Following two vaccine doses, humoral immunity was weaker, less functional and less durable in older adults, where a higher number of chronic health conditions was a key correlate of weaker responses and poorer durability. Third doses boosted antibody binding and function to higher levels than second-doses, and induced responses in older adults that were comparable in magnitude to those in younger adults. Humoral responses against Omicron were universally weaker than against the ancestral strain after both second and third doses; nevertheless, after three doses, anti-Omicron responses in older adults reached equivalence to those in younger adults. After three vaccine doses, the number of chronic health conditions, but not age per se, was the strongest consistent correlate of weaker humoral responses.Conclusion Results underscore the immune benefits of third COVID-19 vaccine doses, particularly in older adults.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada through a COVID-19 Immunology Task Force COVID-19 "Hot Spots" Award (2020-HQ-000120 to MGR, ZLB, MAB).

%X Without any realistic prospect of comprehensive global vaccine coverage and lasting immunity, control of pandemics such as COVID-19 will require implementation of large-scale, rapid identification and isolation of infectious individuals to limit further transmission. Here, we describe an automated, high-throughput integrated screening platform, incorporating saliva-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology, that is designed for population-scale sensitive detection of infectious carriers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Central to this surveillance system is the “Sentinel” testing instrument, which is capable of reporting results within 25 minutes of saliva sample collection with a throughput of up to 3,840 results per hour. It incorporates continuous flow loading of samples at random intervals to cost-effectively adjust for fluctuations in testing demand. Independent validation of our saliva-based RT-LAMP technology on an automated LAMP instrument coined the “Sentinel”, found 98.7% sensitivity, 97.6% specificity, and 98% efficiency against a RT-PCR comparator assay, confirming its suitability for surveillance screening. This Sentinel surveillance system offers a feasible and scalable approach to complement vaccination, to curb the spread of COVID-19 variants, and control future pandemics to save lives.One-Sentence Summary Development of a high-throughput LAMP-based automated continuous flow, random access SARS-CoV-2 screening platform with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to enable pandemic-scale population testing of infectious individuals using saliva sampling.Competing Interest StatementPW and PO are founders of Avicena Systems, SK is founder of the Prion.Funding StatementDevelopment of the Avicena Sentinel Instrument was supported by grants from the Department of Health, Western Australia, Department of Premier and Cabinet of Western Australia, Western Australian Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Industry, and a federal grant Modern Manufacturing Initiative grant from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, Australian Government.

%X Isolation of close contact people and negative test certification are used to manage the spread of new coronavirus infections worldwide. These effectively prevent the spread of infection in advance, but they can lead to a decline in socio-economic activity. Thus, the present study quantified the extent to which isolation and negative test certification respectively reduce the risk of infection. To this end, a discrete-time SEIR model was used as the infectious disease model, and equations for calculating the conditional probability of non-infection status given negative test results on two different days were derived. Then the respective non-infection probabilities with two negative PCR test results, and with one negative PCR test result and one antigen test result, were quantified. By substituting initial parameters of the SEIR model into these probabilities, the present study revealed the following: (1) isolating close contact individuals can reduce by 80% the risk of infection during the first five days, but five more days are needed to reduce the risk 10% more, and seven more days to reduce the risk 20% more; and (2) if an individual with a negative PCR test result has a negative antigen test result the next day, then his or her infection probability is between 0.6% and 0.7%. Our results show that five-day isolation has a proportionally greater effect on risk reduction, compared to longer isolation; and thus, if an isolation period of longer than five days is contemplated, both the risk reduction and the negative effects from such increased isolation should be considered. Regarding negative test certification, our results provide those in managerial positions, who must decide whether to accept the risk and hold mass-gathering events, with quantitative information that may be useful in their decision-making.Competing Interest StatementAmong the outside support for the study, WN and TY report a relationship with Kao Corporation (funding grants); and a relationship with the Nippon Professional Baseball Organization, Yomiuri Giants, Tokyo Yakult Swallows, Japan Professional Football League, and Japan Professional Basketball League (funding grants).

%X A recent MMWR reported that the effectiveness of a 3rd dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine waned quickly in the Omicron-predominant period. Similarly, a substantial decline of immune responses induced by a 3rd dose of inactivated vaccines was also observed in our study. In response to the fast waning immune response and the great threat of Omicron variant of concern (VOC) to frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), 38 HCWs who were in our previous cohort investigating responses to the first three doses of inactivated vaccines participated in the current study and volunteered to receive a 4th homologous booster. Here, we demonstrated that the 4th dose is safe and capable of recalling waned immune responses 6 months after the 3rd dose. However, a greater suppression on the induction of overall Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and NAbs targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) was found in participants with stronger immune responses after the 3rd dose. As a result, a stepwise elevation of RBD-NAbs from the 1st to the 3rd vaccination achieved a “turning point”. The peak RBD-NAbs level induced by the 4th dose was inferior to the peak of the 3rd dose. Accompanied with reduced induction of RBD-NAbs, the immune system shifted responses to the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein. Although NTD directed antibodies are capable of neutralization, they only compensated the loss of RBD-NAbs to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus but not to the Omicron variant due to a substantial conformational change of Omicron NTD. This longitudinal clinical study monitored the immune response of the same cohort for every doses, shaping a relationship between the trajectory of immune focus and the dynamics of the neutralizing potency against the evolving virus. Our data reveal that immune responses could not be endlessly elevated, while suppression of heightened immune responses focusing on one subunit together with a shift of immune responses to other subunits would occur after repeated vaccination. Thus, an updated vaccine with more diverse epitopes capable of inducing NAbs against VOCs would be a future direction for boosters.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialChiCTR2200055564Funding StatementThe work is supported by The Talent Program of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (Y70311), The Hundred Talent Program of Sun Yat-sen University (Y61224), and the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou (202103000076).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Institutional Review Board of FAH-SYSU gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now in widespread use in the United States. RADTs play an important role in maintaining an open society but require periodic reassessment to ensure test performance remains intact as the virus evolves. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is the target for the majority of RADTs and the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has several N protein mutations that are previously uncharacterized. We sought to assess the impact of these mutations by testing 30 Omicron variant samples across a wide range of viral loads on three widely used RADTs: the iHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test, the ACON Laboratories FlowFlex COVID-19 Antigen Home Test, and the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Card, using 30 Delta variant samples as a comparator. We found no change in the analytic sensitivity of all three RADTs for detection of Omicron versus Delta, but noted differences in performance between assays. No RADT was able to detect samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of ≥27.5 for the envelope gene target on the Roche cobas RT-PCR assay. Epidemiologic studies are necessary to correlate these findings with their real-world performance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by a grant from the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was deemed non-human subjects research and approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board (protocol 2021P003604).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with increased levels of autoantibodies targeting immunological proteins such as cytokines and chemokines. Reports further indicate that COVID-19 patients may develop a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases due to reasons not fully understood. Even so, the landscape of autoantibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection remains uncharted territory. To gain more insight, we carried out a comprehensive assessment of autoantibodies known to be linked to diverse autoimmune diseases observed in COVID-19 patients, in a cohort of 248 individuals, of which171 were COVID-19 patients (74 with mild, 65 moderate, and 32 with severe disease) and 77were healthy controls. Dysregulated autoantibody serum levels, characterized mainly by elevated concentrations, occurred mostly in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 infection, and was accompanied by a progressive disruption of physiologic IgG and IgA autoantibody signatures. A similar perturbation was found in patients with anosmia. Notably, autoantibody levels often accompanied anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations, being both indicated by random forest classification as strong predictors of COVID-19 outcome, together with age. Moreover, higher levels of autoantibodies (mainly IgGs) were seen in the elderly with severe disease compared with young COVID-19 patients with severe disease. These findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a broader loss of self-tolerance than previously thought, providing new ideas for therapeutic interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe acknowledge the patients for participation in this study. We would like to acknowledge the contributions of Lev Rochel Bikur Cholim of Lakewood (led by Rabbi Yehuda Kasirer and Mrs. Leeba Prager) and their hundreds of volunteers who participated in collecting samples for this research through the MITZVA Cohort.

%X In this study, we couple compartment models for indoor air quality and disease transmission to develop a novel SEIR-e model for disease transmission and pathogen exposure. In doing so, we gain insight into the contribution of people–people and people–pathogen interactions to the spread of transmissible diseases. A general modelling framework is used to assess the risk of infection in indoor environments due to people–pathogen interactions via inhalation of viral airborne aerosols, and contact with contaminated surfaces. We couple the indoor environment model with a standard disease transmission model to investigate how both people–people and people–pathogen interactions result in disease transmission. The coupled model is referred to as the SEIR-e model. To demonstrate the applicability of the SEIR-e model and the novel insights it can provide into different exposure pathways, parameter values which describe exposure due to people–people and people–pathogen interactions are inferred using Bayesian techniques and case data relating to the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 in Victoria (Australia).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is funded internally by Defence Science and Technology Group.

%X The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the global supply chain and equipment needed for mass testing with RT-qPCR, the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Here, we propose the RT-LAMP assay as an additional strategy for rapid virus diagnosis. However, its validation as a diagnostic method remains uncertain. In this work, we validated the RT-LAMP assay in 1,266 nasopharyngeal swab samples with confirmed diagnosis by CDC 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR. Our cohort was divided, the first (n=984) was used to evaluate two sets of oligonucleotides (S1 and S3) and the second (n=281) to determine whether RT-LAMP could detect samples with several types of variants. This assay can identify positive samples by color change or fluorescence within 40 minutes and shows high concordance with RT-qPCR in samples with CT ≤35. Also, S1 and S3 are able to detect SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of 68.4% and 65.8%, and a specificity of 98.9% and 97.1%, respectively. Furthermore, RT-LAMP assay identified 279 sequenced samples as positive (99.3% sensitivity) corresponding to the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu and Omicron variants. In conclusion, RT-LAMP is able to identify SARS-CoV-2 with good sensitivity and excellent specificity, including all VOC, VOI, VUM and FMV variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the SECTEI de la Ciudad de Mexico (SECTEI/047/2020).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Ethics and Research committees of Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (protocol code CEI/1479/20 and CEI 2020/21).

%X Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has been essential to provide an evidence base for public health decisions throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Sequencing data from clinical cases has provided data crucial to understanding disease transmission and the detection, surveillance, and containment of outbreaks of novel variants, which continue to pose fresh challenges. However, genomic wastewater surveillance can provide important complementary information by providing estimates of variant frequencies which do not suffer from sampling bias, and capturing all variants circulating in a population. Here we show that genomic SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance can detect fine-scale differences within urban centres, specifically within the city of Liverpool, UK, during the emergence of Alpha and Delta variants between November 2020 and June 2021. Overall, the correspondence between wastewater and clinical variant frequencies demonstrates the reliability of wastewater surveillance. Yet, discrepancies between the two approaches when the Alpha variant was first detected emphasises that wastewater monitoring can also capture missing information resulting from asymptomatic cases or communities less engaged with testing programmes, as found by a simultaneous surge testing effort across the city.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocols https://www.protocols.io/view/wastewater-sequencing-using-the-easyseq-rc-pcr-sar-bx6dpra6 Funding StatementFunding was provided by NERC (NE/V003860/1) and DHSC UK (2020_097).

%X Repeated emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased fitness necessitates rapid detection and characterization of new lineages. To address this need, we developed PyR0, a hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that infers relative prevalence of all viral lineages across geographic regions, detects lineages increasing in prevalence, and identifies mutations relevant to fitness. Applying PyR0 to all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identify numerous substitutions that increase fitness, including previously identified spike mutations and many non-spike mutations within the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins. PyR0 forecasts growth of new lineages from their mutational profile, identifies viral lineages of concern as they emerge, and prioritizes mutations of biological and public health concern for functional characterization.One Sentence summary A Bayesian hierarchical model of all SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes predicts lineage fitness and identifies associated mutations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialStudy is based on SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences publicly available at GISAID.org.Clinical Protocols https://github.com/broadinstitute/pyro-cov Funding StatementThis work was sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (BAA), as well as support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (J.E.L.), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (P.C.S.), and the Evergrande COVID-19 Response Fund Award from the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness (J.L.).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was conducted using data from a public database (GISAID).

%X Background Immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has waning antibody over time. With the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, which requires higher neutralizing antibody to prevent infection, a booster dose is needed.Objective To evaluate immunogenicity and reactogenicity of standard- versus low-dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine booster after CoronaVac in healthy adults.Methods A double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of adult, aged 18-59 years, with completion of 2-dose CoronaVac at 21-28 days apart for more than 2 months was conducted. Participants were randomized to receive AZD1222 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) intramuscularly; standard dose (SD, 5×1010 viral particles) or low dose (LD, 2.5×1010 viral particles). Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) against wild type and delta variant, and anti-spike-receptor-binding-domain IgG (anti-S-RBD IgG) were compared as geometric mean ratio (GMR) at day 14 and 90 between LD and SD arms.Results From July-August 2021, 422 adults with median age of 44 (IQR 36–51) years were enrolled. The median interval from CoronaVac to AZD1222 booster was 77 (IQR 64–95) days. At baseline, geometric means (GMs) of sVNT against delta variant and anti-S-RBD IgG were 18.1%inhibition (95%CI 16.4-20.0) and 111.5 (105.1-118.3) BAU/ml. GMs of sVNT against delta variant and anti-S-RBD IgG in SD were 95.6%inhibition (95%CI 94.3-97.0) and 1975.1 (1841.7-2118.2) BAU/ml at day 14, and 89.4%inhibition (86.4-92.4) and 938.6 (859.9-1024.4) BAU/ml at day 90, respectively. GMRs of sVNT against delta variant and anti-S-RBD IgG in LD compared to SD were 1.00 (95%CI 0.98-1.02) and 0.84 (0.76–0.93) at day 14, and 0.98 (0.94-1.03) and 0.89 (0.79-1.00) at day 90, respectively. LD recipients had significantly lower rate of fever (6.8%vs25.0%) and myalgia (51.9%vs70.7%) compared to SD.Conclusion Half-dose AZD1222 booster after 2-dose inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination had non-inferior immunogenicity, yet lower systemic reactogenicity. Fractional low-dose AZD1222 booster should be considered especially in resource-constrained settings.Highlights- Low dose AZD1222 could boost comparable immunity to standard dose in healthy adult who completed 2 doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.- Less reactogenicity occurred in low-dose AZD1222 booster than standard-dose recipients.HighlightsThai Clinical Trials Registry (thaiclinicaltrials.org): TCTR20210722003Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThai Clinical Trials Registry: thaiclinicaltrials.org, TCTR20210722003.Funding StatementThe study was funded by the Ratchadapisek Sompoch Endowment Fund (2021) under Health Research Platform (764002-HE07), Chulalongkorn University and Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University.

%X Background Isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of their contacts are usually employed to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. While 14-day isolation of infected individuals could effectively reduce the risk of subsequence transmission, it also significantly impacts the patient’s financial, psychological, and emotional well-being. It is, therefore, vital to investigate how the isolation duration could be shortened when effective vaccines are available and in what circumstances we can live with COVID-19 without isolation and quarantine.Methods An individual-based modeling approach was employed to estimate the likelihood of secondary infections and the likelihood of an outbreak following the isolation of an index case for a range of isolation periods. Our individual-based model integrates the viral loads and infectiousness profiles of vaccinated and unvaccinated infected individuals. The effects of waning vaccine-induced immunity against Delta and Omicron variant transmission were also investigated.Results In the baseline scenario in which all individuals are unvaccinated, and no nonpharmaceutical interventions are employed, there is a chance of about 3% that an unvaccinated index case will make at least one secondary infection after being isolated for 14 days, and a sustained chain of transmission can occur with a chance of less than 1%. We found that at the outbreak risk equivalent to that of 14-day isolation in the baseline scenario, the isolation duration can be shortened to 7.33 days (95% CI 6.68-7.98) if 75% of people in the community are fully vaccinated during the last three months. In the best-case scenario in which all individuals in the community are fully vaccinated, isolation of infected individuals may no longer be necessary. However, to keep the outbreak risk low, a booster vaccination may be necessary three months after full vaccination. Finally, our simulations showed that the reduced vaccine effectiveness against transmission of the Omicron variant does not much affect the risk of an outbreak if the vaccine effectiveness against infection is maintained at a high level via booster vaccination.Conclusions The isolation duration of a vaccine breakthrough infector could be safely shortened if a majority of people in the community are immune to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A booster vaccination may be necessary three months after full vaccination to keep the outbreak risk low.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Research Council of Thailand, the Thailand Center of Excellence in Physics (ThEP), the Centre of Excellence in Mathematics, the Center of Excellence on Medical Biotechnology (CEMB), the Science, Research and Innovation Promotion and Utilization Division, the Office of the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Thailand.

%X Background Waning immunity and the surge of SARS-CoV-2 variants are responsible for breakthrough infections, i.e. infections in fully vaccinated individuals. Although the majority of vaccinated infected subjects reports mild or no symptoms, some others require hospitalization. The clinical and immunological features of vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients are currently unknown.Methods 29 unvaccinated and 36 vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients were prospectively enrolled and clinical and laboratory data. Immunophenotyping of leukocytes’ subsets, T and B cell SARS-CoV-2 specific responses were evaluated via flow cytometry. Anti-IFN-α autoantibodies were measured via ELISA.Results Despite vaccinated patients were older and with more comorbidities, unvaccinated subjects showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers, more severe disease and increased mortality rate. Accordingly, they presented significant alterations in the circulating leukocyte composition, typical of severe COVID-19. Vaccinated patients displayed higher levels of anti-Spike IgGs and Spike-specific B cells. Of all participants, survivors showed higher levels of anti-Spike IgGs and S-specific CD4+ T cells than non-survivors. At hospital admission, 6 out of 65 patients (9.2%) displayed high serum concentrations of autoantibodies targeting IFN-α. Remarkably, 3 were unvaccinated and eventually died, while the other 3 were vaccinated and survived.Conclusion Despite more severe pre-existing clinical conditions, vaccinated patients have good outcome. A rapid activation of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity is fundamental for the resolution of the infection.

%X A third mRNA-based “booster” vaccination is the favored strategy to maintain protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, significant waning of specific immunity within six months after 2nd vaccination, along with higher incidence of breakthrough infections associated with the time elapsed since 2nd vaccination raises concerns regarding the durability of immunity also after 3rd vaccination. We assessed virus-specific serum antibody and T cell response in the blood after vaccination with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in more than 50 individuals older than 80 years. All old adults demonstrated a strong humoral response to 3rd vaccination which was at average higher and waned slower than the response to 2nd vaccination, indicative of enhanced humoral immunity. In contrast, their respective T cell response quantitatively limited to the level obtained after 2nd vaccination, with similar waning over time and no evidence for enhanced IFNg production. Because BNT162b2-mediated protection from the Omicron variant relies more on T cells than antibodies, our findings raise concern on the durability of protection from the Omicron variant by BNT162b2 in the senior population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported in part by grants of the Government of Hesse (Pandemie Netzwerk), Germany, by the Else-Kroener-Fresenius-Stiftung, Germany, the Senate of Berlin and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant LO 396/8-1 to MLAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of the medical faculty of the Philipps-University Marburg gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Individual variation in susceptibility and exposure is subject to selection by natural infection, accelerating the acquisition of immunity, and reducing herd immunity thresholds and epidemic final sizes. This is a manifestation of a wider population phenomenon known as “frailty variation”. Despite theoretical understanding, public health policies continue to be guided by mathematical models that leave out considerable variation and as a result inflate projected disease burdens and overestimate the impact of interventions. Here we focus on trajectories of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in England and Scotland until November 2021. We fit models to series of daily deaths and infer relevant epidemiological parameters, including coefficients of variation and effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions which we find in agreement with independent empirical estimates based on contact surveys. Our estimates are robust to whether the analysed data series encompass one or two pandemic waves and enable projections compatible with subsequent dynamics. We conclude that vaccination programmes may have contributed modestly to the acquisition of herd immunity in populations with high levels of pre-existing naturally acquired immunity, while being critical to protect vulnerable individuals from severe outcomes as the virus becomes endemic.HighlightsVariation in susceptibility/exposure responds to selection by natural infectionSelection on susceptibility/exposure flattens epidemic curvesModels with incomplete heterogeneity overestimate intervention impactsIndividual variation lowered the natural herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:N/AI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have made great challenges to current vaccine and pandemic control strategies. B.1.1.529 (Omicron), which was classified as a variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization on November 26th, 2021, has quickly become the dominant circulating variant and causing waves of infections. It is urgent to understand the current immune status of the general population given that pre-existing immunity has been established by national vaccination or exposure to past variants. Using sera from 85 individuals (including 21 convalescents of natural infection, 15 cases suffered a breakthrough infection after vaccination, and 49 vaccinated participants without infection history), we showed that the cross-neutralizing activity against VOCs such as Omicron can be detected in 53 (62.4%) cases, although less potent than against the Wuhan-1 strain (WT), with a 3.9-fold reduction in geometric mean neutralizing titer (GMT) (130.7, 95% CI 88.4-193.3 vs 506, 355.8-719.7, respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed significantly enhanced neutralizing activity against WT and VOCs in Delta convalescent sera. The neutralizing antibodies against Omicron were detectable in 75% of convalescents and 44.9% of healthy donors (p = 0.006), with a GMT of 289.5, 180.9-463.3 and 42.6, 31.3-59, respectively. However, the protective effect against VOCs was weaker in young convalescents (aged &lt; 18y), with a detectable rate of 50% and a GMT of 46.4 against Omicron, similar to vaccinees. The pan-sarbecovirus neutralizing activities were not observed in vaccinated SARS-CoV-1 survivors. A booster dose significantly increased the breadth and magnitude of neutralization against WT and VOCs to different degrees than full vaccination. In addition, we showed that COVID-19 inactivated vaccines can elicit Omicron-specific T cell responses. The positive rates of ELISpot reactions were 26.7% (4/15) and 43.8% (7/16) in the full vaccination group and the booster vaccination group, respectively. The neutralizing antibody titers declined while T-cell responses remain robust over 6 months. These findings will inform the optimization of public health vaccination and intervention strategies to protect diverse populations against SARS-CoV-2 variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was funded by Xiamen University grant no. 20720200017 and 20720200032.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics Institute of Xiamen University Xiang'an HospitalI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Introduction Viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has been used for outbreak investigation, but there is limited evidence supporting routine use for infection prevention and control (IPC) within hospital settings.Methods We conducted a prospective non-randomised trial of sequencing at 14 acute UK hospital trusts. Sites each had a 4-week baseline data-collection period, followed by intervention periods comprising 8 weeks of ‘rapid’ (&lt;48h) and 4 weeks of ‘longer-turnaround’ (5-10 day) sequencing using a sequence reporting tool (SRT). Data were collected on all hospital onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs; detected ≥48h from admission). The impact of the sequencing intervention on IPC knowledge and actions, and on incidence of probable/definite hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) was evaluated.Results A total of 2170 HOCI cases were recorded from October 2020-April 2021, with sequence reports returned for 650/1320 (49.2%) during intervention phases. We did not detect a statistically significant change in weekly incidence of HAIs in longer-turnaround (IRR 1.60, 95%CI 0.85-3.01; P=0.14) or rapid (0.85, 0.48-1.50; P=0.54) intervention phases compared to baseline phase. However, IPC practice was changed in 7.8% and 7.4% of all HOCI cases in rapid and longer-turnaround phases, respectively, and 17.2% and 11.6% of cases where the report was returned. In a per-protocol sensitivity analysis there was an impact on IPC actions in 20.7% of HOCI cases when the SRT report was returned within 5 days.Conclusion While we did not demonstrate a direct impact of sequencing on the incidence of nosocomial transmission, our results suggest that sequencing can inform IPC response to HOCIs, particularly when returned within 5 days.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04405934Clinical Protocols https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255342v1 Funding StatementCOG-UK is supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) part of UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI), the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) [grant code: MC_PC_19027], and Genome Research Limited, operating as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:NHS HRA gave ethical approval for this work (ref: REC 20/EE/0118).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Understanding the characteristics and natural history of novel pathogens is crucial to inform successful control measures. Japan was one of the first affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic reporting their first case on 14 January 2020. Interventions including airport screening, contact tracing, and cluster investigations were quickly implemented. Here we present insights from the first 3 months of the epidemic in Japan based on detailed case data.Methods We conducted descriptive analyses based on information systematically extracted from individual case reports from 13 January to 31 March 2020 including patient demographics, date of report and symptom onset, symptom progression, travel history, and contact type. We analysed symptom progression and estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, correcting for epidemic growth using an established Bayesian framework. Key delays and the age-specific probability of transmission were estimated using data on exposures and transmission pairs.Results The corrected fitted mean onset-to-reporting delay after the peak was 4 days (standard deviation: ±2 days). Early transmission was driven primarily by returning travellers with Rt peaking at 2.4 (95%CrI:1.6, 3.3) nationally. In the final week of the trusted period, Rt accounting for importations diverged from overall Rt at 1.1 (95% CrI: 1.0, 1.2) compared to 1.5 (95% CrI: 1.3, 1.6) respectively. Household (39.0%) and workplace (11.6%) exposures were the most frequently reported potential source of infection. The estimated probability of transmission was assortative by age. Across all age groups, cases most frequently onset with cough, fever, and fatigue. There were no reported cases of patients &lt;20 years old developing pneumonia or severe respiratory symptoms.Conclusions Information collected in the early phases of an outbreak are important in characterising any novel pathogen. Timely recognition of key symptoms and high-risk settings for transmission can help to inform response strategies. The data analysed here were the result of robust and timely investigations and demonstrate the improvements to epidemic control as a result of such surveillance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe acknowledge funding from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (reference MR/R015600/1), jointly funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO), under the MRC/FCDO Concordat agreement and is also part of the EDCTP2 programme supported by the European Union; and acknowledges funding by Community Jameel.

%X Vaccination and infection by viral variants are shaping population immunity to SARS-CoV-21 and breakthrough infections of vaccinated or previously infected individuals have become common as variants evade preexisting immunity. Omicron (B.1.1.529) is highly resistant to plasma neutralizing antibodies elicited by infection with prior variants and the 2-dose mRNA vaccination regimens. However, vaccination after infection or a third mRNA vaccine dose elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies that can also neutralize omicron to a degree2-4. We compared neutralizing antibody titers in 54 individuals that had received 2 or 3 doses of mRNA vaccines and had experienced breakthrough infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants.Competing Interest StatementPDB has received compensation from Pfizer for consultation in the area of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinesFunding StatementNIH Robert S Wennett Post-Doctoral Fellowship National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences Shapiro Silverberg Fund for the Advancement of Translational Research Howard Hughes Medical Institute InvestigatorsAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations, and the protocol (DRO-1006) for studies with human participants was approved by the institutional review board of The Rockefeller University.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Rapid antigen (RA) tests are being increasingly employed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in quarantine and surveillance. Prior research has focused on RT-PCR testing, a single RA test, or generic diagnostic characteristics of RA tests in assessing testing strategies.Methods For 18 RA tests with emergency use authorization from the United States of America FDA and an RT-PCR test, we conducted a comparative analysis of the post-quarantine transmission, the effective reproduction number during serial testing, and the false-positive rates. To quantify the extent of transmission, we developed an analytical mathematical framework informed by COVID-19 infectiousness, test specificity, and temporal diagnostic sensitivity data.Results We demonstrate that the relative effectiveness of RA and RT-PCR tests in reducing post-quarantine transmission depends on the quarantine duration and the turnaround time of testing results. For quarantines of two days or shorter, conducting a RA test on exit from quarantine reduces onward transmission more than a single RT-PCR test (with a 24-h delay) conducted upon exit. Applied to a complementary approach of performing serial testing at a specified frequency paired with isolation of positives, we have shown that RA tests outperform RT-PCR with a 24-h delay. The results from our modeling framework are consistent with quarantine and serial testing data collected from a remote industry setting.Conclusions These RA test-specific results are an important component of the tool set for policy decision-making, and demonstrate that judicious selection of an appropriate RA test can supply a viable alternative to RT-PCR in efforts to control the spread of disease.Plain language summary Previous research has determined optimal timing for testing in quarantine and the utility of different frequencies of testing for disease surveillance using RT-PCR and generalized rapid antigen tests.However, these strategies can depend on the specific rapid antigen test used. By examining 18 rapid antigen tests, we demonstrate that a single rapid antigen test performs better than RT-PCR when quarantines are two days or less in duration. In the context of disease surveillance, the ability of a rapid antigen test to provide results quickly counteracts its lower sensitivity with potentially more false positives. These analytical results based on highly controlled test validation were consistent with real-world data obtained from quarantine and serial testing in an industrial setting.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Notsew Orm Sands Foundation BHP and BP.

%X There is still a need for safe, efficient and low-cost coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that can stop transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we evaluated a vaccine candidate based on a live recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that expresses a stable version of the spike protein in infected cells as well as on the surface of the viral particle (AVX/COVID-12-HEXAPRO, also known as NDV-HXP-S). This vaccine candidate can be grown in embryonated eggs at low cost similar to influenza virus vaccines and it can also be administered intranasally, potentially to induce mucosal immunity. We evaluated this vaccine candidate in prime-boost regimens via intramuscular, intranasal, or intranasal followed by intramuscular routes in an open label non-randomized non-placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial in Mexico in 91 volunteers. The primary objective of the trial was to assess vaccine safety and the secondary objective was to determine the immunogenicity of the different vaccine regimens. In the interim analysis reported here, the vaccine was found to be safe and the higher doses tested were found to be immunogenic when given intramuscularly or intranasally followed by intramuscular administration, providing the basis for further clinical development of the vaccine candidate.

%X SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron strains are the most globally relevant variants of concern (VOCs). While individuals infected with Delta are at risk to develop severe lung disease1, Omicron infection causes less severe disease, mostly upper respiratory symptoms2,3. The question arises whether rampant spread of Omicron could lead to mass immunization, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that infection with Delta, but not Omicron, induces broad immunity in mice. While sera from Omicron-infected mice only neutralize Omicron, sera from Delta-infected mice are broadly effective against Delta and other VOCs, including Omicron. This is not observed with the WA1 ancestral strain, although both WA1 and Delta elicited a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine response and replicated to similar titers in the respiratory tracts and lungs of infected mice as well as in human airway organoids. Pulmonary viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and overall disease progression are markedly reduced with Omicron infection. Analysis of human sera from Omicron and Delta breakthrough cases reveals effective cross-variant neutralization induced by both viruses in vaccinated individuals. Together, our results indicate that Omicron infection enhances preexisting immunity elicited by vaccines, but on its own may not induce broad, cross-neutralizing humoral immunity in unvaccinated individuals.Competing Interest StatementA.M.S. and J.A.D. are inventors on a patent application filed by the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California that covers the method and composition of SARS-CoV-2 VLP preparations for RNA transduction and expression in cells.

%X During a fast-moving epidemic, timely monitoring of case counts and other key indicators of disease spread is critical to an effective public policy response. We describe a nonparametric statistical method, originally applied to the reporting of AIDS cases in the 1980s, to estimate the distribution of reporting delays of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City during the late summer and early fall of 2020. During August 15 - September 26, the estimated mean delay in reporting was 3.3 days, with 87 percent of cases reported by 5 days from diagnosis. Relying upon the estimated reporting-delay distribution, we projected COVID-19 incidence during the most recent three weeks as if each case had instead been reported on the same day that the underlying diagnostic test had been performed. Applying our delay-corrected estimates to case counts reported as of September 26, we projected a surge in new diagnoses that had already occurred but had yet to be reported. Our projections were consistent with counts of confirmed cases subsequently reported by November 7. The resulting estimate of recently diagnosed cases could have had an impact on timely policy decisions to tighten social distancing measures. While the recent advent of widespread rapid antigen testing has changed the diagnostic testing landscape considerably, delays in public reporting of SARS-CoV-2 case counts remain an important barrier to effective public health policy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThere are no funding sources to declare.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study relies exclusively on publicly available, aggregate health data that contain no individual identifiers.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Global population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is accumulating through heterogenous combinations of infection and vaccination. Vaccine distribution in low- and middle-income countries has been variable and reliant on diverse vaccine platforms. We studied B-cell immunity in Mexico, a middle-income country where five different vaccines have been deployed to populations with high SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Levels of antibodies that bound a stabilized prefusion spike trimer, neutralizing antibody titers and memory B-cell expansion correlated with each other across vaccine platforms. Nevertheless, the vaccines elicited variable levels of B-cell immunity, and the majority of recipients had undetectable neutralizing activity against the recently emergent omicron variant. SARS-CoV-2 infection, experienced prior to or after vaccination potentiated B-cell immune responses and enabled the generation of neutralizing activity against omicron and SARS-CoV for all vaccines in nearly all individuals. These findings suggest that broad population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will eventually be achieved, but by heterogenous pathsCompeting Interest StatementPDB has received compensation from Pfizer for consultation in the area of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinesFunding StatementThis work was supported by the Mexican Government (Programa Presupuestal P016; Anexo 13 del Decreto del Presupuesto de Egresos de la Federacion) by NIH grants R37AI64003 and R01AI501111 (PDB); R01AI78788 (TH) and P01AI165075 (PDB and TH)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Protocols set forth and approved by the Comite de Etica en Investigacion and the Comite de Investigacion (Research Ethics Committee and the Research Committee) from INER Institutional Review Board (study no.

%X Following infection with SARS-CoV-2, virus-specific antibodies are generated which can both neutralise virions and clear infection via Fc effector functions. The importance of IgG antibodies for protection and control of SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively reported. In comparison, other antibody isotypes including IgA have been poorly characterized. Here we characterized plasma IgA from 41 early convalescent COVID-19 subjects for neutralisation and Fc effector functions. We find that convalescent plasma IgA from &gt;60% of the cohort have the capacity to inhibit the interaction between wild-type RBD and ACE2. Furthermore, a third of the cohort induced stronger IgA-mediated inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 than IgG, when tested at equivalent concentrations. Plasma IgA and IgG from the cohort, broadly recognize similar RBD epitopes and showed similar ability to inhibit ACE2 from binding 22 of 23 different prevalent RBD proteins with single amino acid mutations. Plasma IgA was largely incapable of mediating antibody-dependent phagocytosis in comparison to plasma IgG. Overall, convalescent plasma IgA contributes to neutralisation towards wild-type RBD and various RBD single mutants in most subjects, although this response is heterogeneous and less potent than IgG.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) (W.H.T., D.I.G., A.W.C., S.J.K., A.K.W. and J.A.J), Emergent Ventures Fast Grant (A.W.C.) and the Paul Ramsay Foundation (D.I.G., S.J.K., A.K.W and A.W.C).

%X Importance Duration of post-vaccination protection against COVID-19 in individuals is a critical issue, especially in nursing home (NH) residents, i.e. one of the most vulnerable populations.Objective To estimate the duration of the IgG(S) response to the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine in NH residents with (COV-Yes) or without (COV-No) history of natural infection with SARS-CoV-2.Design, setting and participants IgG(S) quantification was carried out at 3 different time periods following administration of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine: three then seven months after the 2nd dose and one month after the 3rd dose. 574 COV-Yes and COV-No NH residents were included in 2 cohorts: Main (n=115, mean age 84 years) or Confirmatory (n=459, mean age 88 years).Exposure All subjects received the BNT162b2 vaccine.Main outcomes and measurements IgG(S) antibodies and seroneutralization capacity.Results Neutralization capacity was strongly correlated with IgG(S) levels (R2:76%) without any difference between COV-Yes and COV-No groups for the same levels of IgG(S). COV-Yes, compared to the COV-No subjects showed 5-fold and 15-fold higher IgG(S) titers 3 and 7 months after the 2nd dose, but less than 2-fold higher IgG(S) after the 3rd dose, due to a more pronounced effect of the 3rd dose in the COV-No group. These results were similar in both cohorts. After the 2nd dose, duration of assumed robust protection (IgG(S) &gt;264 BAU/ml) was 2-fold higher in the COV-Yes vs. COV-No group: 12.60 (10.69-14.44) vs 5.76 (3.91-8.64) months, and this advantage was mainly due to the higher IgG(S) titers after the 2nd dose and secondary to a slower decay over time. After the 3rd dose, duration (months) of robust protection was estimated at 11.87 (9.88-14.87) (COV-Yes) and 8.95 (6.85-11.04) (COV-No).Conclusions and relevance In old subjects living in NH, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection provides a clear advantage in the magnitude and duration of high IgG(S) titers following the 2nd dose. Importantly, the 3rd dose induces a much more pronounced IgG(S) response than the 2nd dose in COV-No subjects, the effect of which should be able to ensure in these subjects a prolonged protection against severe forms of COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study has been supported by the PIA project Lorraine Universite Excellence reference ANR-15-IDEX-04-LUEAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics Committee of the Nancy University Hospital CHRU de Nancy gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Most adults in India have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and also been infected naturally during the pandemic. As immunization of individuals continues under this situation where the virus has attained endemicity, we assessed whether this hybrid immunity is further boosted by a single dose of BBV152, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and, if these antibodies can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants. We found that natural infection during the second wave in 2021 led to generation of neutralizing antibodies against other lineages of SARS-CoV-2 including the omicron variant, albeit at a significantly lower level for the latter. A single dose of BBV152 boosted antibody titers against the delta and the omicron variants but the antibody levels remained low for the omicron variant. Boosting of antibodies showed negative correlation with baseline neutralizing antibody titers suggesting anergy of the immune system in individuals with high levels of antibodies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) through IndCEPI Mission (BT/MB/CEPI/2016), Translational Research Program (BT/PR30159/MED/15/188/2018) and Global Immunology and Immune Sequencing for Epidemic Response (INV-030592).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Institutional ethics committees for human research at ESIC Hospital and Medical College and THSTI.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) has three major lineages BA.1, BA.2, and BA.31. BA.1 rapidly became dominant and has demonstrated substantial escape from neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) induced by vaccination2-4. BA.2 has recently increased in frequency in multiple regions of the world, suggesting that BA.2 has a selective advantage over BA.1. BA.1 and BA.2 share multiple common mutations, but both also have unique mutations1 (Fig. 1A). The ability of BA.2 to evade NAbs induced by vaccination or infection has not yet been reported. We evaluated WA1/2020, Omicron BA.1, and BA.2 NAbs in 24 individuals who were vaccinated and boosted with the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine5 and in 8 individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors acknowledge NIH grant CA260476, the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness, the Ragon Institute, and the Musk Foundation (D.H.B.), as well as the Reproductive Scientist Development Program from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development and Burroughs Wellcome Fund HD000849 (A.Y.C.).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The BIDMC institutional review board approved this study (2020P000361).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 following infection and vaccination are less characterised than antibody responses, due to a more complex experimental pathway.Methods We measured T cell responses in 108 healthcare workers (HCWs) in an observational cohort study, using the commercialised Oxford Immunotec T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 assay (OI T-SPOT) and the PITCH ELISpot protocol established for academic research settings.Results Both assays detected T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. Responses were significantly lower when reported by OI T-SPOT than by PITCH ELISpot. Four weeks after two doses of either Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 vaccine, the responder rate was 63% for OI T-SPOT Panels1+2 (peptides representing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein excluding regions present in seasonal coronaviruses), 69% for OI T-SPOT Panel 14 (peptides representing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike), and 94% for the PITCH ELISpot assay. The two OI T-SPOT panels correlated strongly with each other showing that either readout quantifies spike-specific T cell responses, although the correlation between the OI T-SPOT panels and the PITCH ELISpot was moderate.Conclusion The standardisation, relative scalability and longer interval between blood acquisition and processing are advantages of the commercial OI T-SPOT assay. However, the OI T-SPOT assay measures T cell responses at a significantly lower magnitude compared to the PITCH ELISpot assay, detecting T cell responses in a lower proportion of vaccinees. This has implications for the reporting of low-level T cell responses that may be observed in patient populations and for the assessment of T cell durability after vaccination.Competing Interest StatementS.J.D declares fees as a Scientific Advisor to the Scottish Parliament on COVID-19.

%X Introduction The willingness of Africa’s population to take the COVID-19 vaccines is critical to the efficiency of national immunisation programmes. This study surveys the views of adult African inhabitants toward vaccination and the possibility of participating or not participating in governments’ efforts to get citizens vaccinated.Method A cross-sectional online survey of adult Africans was undertaken from December 2020 to March 2021. Responses were anonymised. The Pearson Chi-square test was performed to determine whether or not there were any variations in knowledge, awareness, perception and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines among the participants. Binomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors associated with willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines and participate in immunisation programmes.Results The results indicate that COVID-19 vaccines are more likely to be used by adult Africans over the age of 18 who are largely technologically savvy (55 percent) if the vaccine is made broadly available. A total of 33 percent of those who responded said they were unlikely to receive the vaccine, with another 15 percent stating they were undecided. Aside from that, we found that vaccine hesitancy was closely associated with socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education and source of information. We also found that there were widespread conspiracies and myths about the COVID-19 vaccines.Conclusion More than two-thirds of African adults who participated in the survey indicated they would not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, with majority of them expressing skepticisms about the vaccine’s efficacy. It is possible that many of the people who would not be vaccinated would have an impact on the implementation of a COVID-19 immunisation programme that is meant for all of society. Majority of the respondents were unwilling to pay for the COVID-19 vaccines when made available. An awareness campaign should be focused on promoting the benefits of vaccination at the individual and population levels, as well as on taking preemptive actions to debunk misconceptions about the vaccines before they become further widespread.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical clearance was granted by the Ethics Review Board (ERB) of the School of Postgraduate Studies and Research, Amoud University in Somalia.

%X Background CoronaVac® is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approved by the World Health Organization. Previous studies reported increased levels of neutralizing antibodies and specific T cells two- and four-weeks after two doses of CoronaVac®, but the levels of neutralizing antibodies are reduced at six to eight months after two doses. Here we report the effect of a booster dose of CoronaVac® on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response generated against variants of concern (VOC) Delta and Omicron in adults participating in a phase 3 clinical trial in Chile.Methods Volunteers immunized with two doses of CoronaVac® in a four-week interval received a booster dose of the same vaccine between twenty-four and thirty weeks after the 2nd dose. Four weeks after the booster dose, neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses were measured. Neutralization capacities and T cell activation against VOC Delta and Omicron were detected at four weeks after the booster dose.Findings We observed a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies at four weeks after the booster dose. We also observed an increase in CD4+ T cells numbers over time, reaching a peak at four weeks after the booster dose. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells induced by the booster showed activity against VOC Delta and Omicron.Interpretation Our results show that a booster dose of CoronaVac® increases the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immune responses in adults. Immunity induced by a booster dose of CoronaVac® is active against VOC, suggesting an effective protection.Competing Interest StatementZG and MW are SINOVAC employees and contributed to the conceptualization of the study (clinical protocol and eCRF design) and did not participate in the analysis or interpretation of the data presented in the manuscript.

%X Although COVID-19 vaccines are globally available, waning immunity and emerging vaccine-evasive variants of concern have hindered the international response as COVID-19 cases continue to rise. Mitigating COVID-19 requires testing to identify and isolate infectious individuals. We developed a stochastic compartmentalized model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States and India using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, rapid antigen tests, and vaccinations. We detail the optimal testing frequency and coverage in the US and India to mitigate an emerging outbreak even in a vaccinated population: overall, maximizing frequency is more important, but high coverage remains necessary when there is sustained transmission. We show that a resource-limited vaccination strategy still requires high-frequency testing and is 16.50% more effective in India than the United States. Tailoring testing strategies to transmission settings can help effectively reduce cases more than if a uniform approach is employed without regard to differences in location.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study involves only publically available datasets, either available through the U.S. Center for Disease Control or peer-reviewed studies.

%X As record cases due to the Omicron variant are currently registered in Europe, schools remain a vulnerable setting suffering large disruption. Extending previous modeling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools in France, we estimate that at high incidence rates reactive screening protocols (as currently applied in France) require comparable test resources as weekly screening (as currently applied in some Swiss cantons), for considerably lower control. Our findings can be used to define incidence levels triggering school protocols and optimizing their cost-effectiveness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was partially funded by: ANR projects COSCREEN (ANR-21-CO16-0005) and DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03); ANRS-MIE project EMERGEN (ANRS0151); EU H2020 grants MOOD (H2020-874850) and RECOVER (H2020-101003589); EU HORIZON grant VERDI (101045989); REACTing COVID-19 grant.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Production of affordable coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in low- and middle-income countries is needed. NDV-HXP-S is an inactivated egg-based Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine expressing the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Wuhan-Hu-1. The spike protein was stabilized and incorporated into NDV virions by removing the polybasic furin cleavage site, introducing the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the fusion protein of NDV, and introducing six prolines for stabilization in the prefusion state. Vaccine production and clinical development was initiated in Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil. Here the interim results from the first stage of the randomized, dose-escalation, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial conducted at the Hanoi Medical University (Vietnam) are presented. Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, non-pregnant, and with self-reported negative history for SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible. Participants were randomized to receive one of five treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28 days apart: 1 μg +/-CpG1018 (a toll-like receptor 9 agonist), 3 μg alone, 10 μg alone, or placebo. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The primary outcomes were solicited adverse events (AEs) during 7 days and subject-reported AEs during 28 days after each vaccination. Investigators further reviewed subject-reported AEs. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity measures (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and pseudotyped virus neutralization). This interim analysis assessed safety 56 days after first vaccination (day 57) in treatment-exposed individuals and immunogenicity through 14 days after second vaccination (day 43) per protocol. Between March 15 and April 23, 2021, 224 individuals were screened and 120 were enrolled (25 per group for active vaccination and 20 for placebo). All subjects received two doses. The most common solicited AEs among those receiving active vaccine or placebo were all predominantly mild and included injection site pain or tenderness (&lt;58%), fatigue or malaise (&lt;22%), headache (&lt;21%), and myalgia (&lt;14%). No higher proportion of the solicited AEs were observed for any group of active vaccine. The proportion reporting vaccine-related AEs during the 28 days after either vaccination ranged from 4% to 8% among vaccine groups and was 5% in controls. No vaccine-related serious adverse event occurred. The immune response in the 10 μg formulation group was highest, followed by 1 μg +CpG1018, 3 μg, and 1 μg formulations. Fourteen days after the second vaccination, the geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of 50% neutralizing antibody against the homologous Wuhan-Hu-1 pseudovirus ranged from 56.07 IU/mL (1 μg, 95% CI 37.01, 84.94) to 246.19 IU/mL (10 μg, 95% CI 151.97, 398.82), with 84% to 96% of vaccine groups attaining a ≥ 4-fold increase over baseline. This was compared to a panel of human convalescent sera (N=29, 72.93 95% CI 33.00-161.14). Live virus neutralization to the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of concern was reduced but in line with observations for vaccines currently in use. Since the adjuvant has shown modest benefit, GMC ratio of 2.56 (95% CI, 1.4 - 4.6) for 1 μg +/-CpG1018, a decision was made not to continue studying it with this vaccine. NDV-HXP-S had an acceptable safety profile and potent immunogenicity. The 3 μg dose was advanced to phase 2 along with a 6 μg dose. The 10 μg dose was not selected for evaluation in phase 2 due to potential impact on manufacturing capacity.

%X Policy decisions during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic were complicated due to virus variants and the impacts of societal restrictions. Accurate predictive models were required in this context. In this paper we report results from a model that helped in predicting the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission in India over a period of a number of months from June, 2021 to March 2022. These models were applied in the context of enabling policy decisions to tackle the impact of the pandemic in India culminating in early warning projections for the Omicron variant and used for advise on preemptive policy actions.Methods Our model utilizes a deterministic compartment models incorporating a dynamic transmission factor, dependent on the population’s behavior as a function of the reported confirmed cases of virus transmission as well as methods for estimation of the increase in susceptible population when social distancing mandates are relaxed. The model used to predict viral growth incorporates the state of vaccination and the virus variants that form part of the transmission dynamics as well the lockdown state of the population. NPI actions were used in India to contain the spread of infections during the period of study, especially during the surge of the Omicron variant of the virus. Further we present the impact of lockdown policies and illustrate the advantage of adopting partial lockdown policies in the early period of 2022. Based on the models, our predictive analysis, when applied to the Omicron variant, illustrated substantial improvement even when partial lockdown is planned.Findings This report presents models and results that incorporated the impact of vaccination rates and the Omicron variant and were used to establish projections on the growth of Sars-Cov2 infections in India for the period from July 2021 till March 2022. The growth rate of the Omicron virus was deduced from data that originated from South Africa in November 2021. These projections were submitted to a pivotal government organization involved in developing a national public health strategy to address the pandemic and, as per personal communication, were considered when formulating national policy. The pandemic had a subdued impact in India during the period from July 2021 till date as evident from the deaths reported by the government. The projections were made every month and cases were projected over the next 4-16 weeks. The projections of cumulative cases during the Omicron wave had low errors when measured using RMSE per capita and had a MAPE error of 17.8% when measured 15 days after start of the projection on December 5th, 2021.Discussion The composed model was found to be useful in providing predictive and data based analytic input to inform early warning approaches in the context of policy based interventions to control the pandemic in India. The model provided monthly early prediction of the spread and impact of the SARS-COV-2 virus in India, state-wise, during the phase of removal of government lockdown in the second half of 2021. The early warning system incorporated the impact of the Omicron variant to provide predictions for Indian states and the country.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded in part by National Science Foundation, USA (Grant No. 2028274)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Openly available data from MOHW, India available at: https://github.com/datameet/covid19/blob/master/data/mohfw.json I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech) and ChAdOx1(Oxford-AstraZeneca) are two widely used COVID-19 vaccines. We examined the immunogenicity of four COVID-19 booster vaccine: BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm Biotech), ChAdOx1, 30μg-BNT162b2 and 15μg-BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), in healthy adults who received a two-dose CoronaVac or ChAdOx1 8-12 weeks earlier. Among the 352 participants (179 CoronaVac and 173 ChAdOx1 participants), 285 (81%) were female, and median age was 39(IQR: 31-47) years. 98%(175/179) and 99%(172/173) of Coronavac and ChAdOx1 participants remained seropositive at baseline. Two weeks post-booster, both 30μg- and 15μg-BNT162b2 induced the highest anti-RBD IgG concentration (BAU/mL); Coronavac-prime: 30μg-BNT162b2, 5152.2(95%CI 4491.7-5909.8); 15μg-BNT162b2, 3981.1(3397.2-4665.4); ChAdOx1, 1358.0(1141.8-1615.1); BBIBP-CorV, 154.6(92.11-259.47); ChAdOx1-prime: 30μg-BNT162b2, 2363.8(2005.6-2786.1; 15μg-BNT162b2, 1961.9(1624.6-2369.1); ChAdOx1, 246.4(199.6-304.2); BBIBP-CorV, 128.1(93.5-175.4). Similarly, both 30μg- and 15μg-BNT162b2 boosting induced the highest neutralizing antibodies (nAb) titres against all variants and highest T-cell response evaluated by interferon gamma released asssays. While all BNT162b2 or heterologous ChAdOx1-boosted participants had nAb against Omicron, these were &lt;50% for BBIBP-CorV and 75% for homologous ChAdOx1-boosted participants. There was significant decrease in nAb (&gt;4-fold) 16-20 weeks post booster. Heterologous boosting with BNT162b2 following CoronaVac or ChAdOx1 primary series is most immunogenic. A lower dose BNT162b2 may be considered as booster in settings with limited vaccine supply.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialTCTR20210719006Funding StatementThis study was supported by the National Research Council of Thailand.

%X Background While the biomarkers of COVID-19 severity have been thoroughly investigated, the key biological dynamics associated with COVID-19 resolution are still insufficiently understood.Main body We report a case of full resolution of severe COVID-19 due to convalescent plasma transfusion in a patient with underlying multiple autoimmune syndrome. Following transfusion, the patient showed fever remission, improved respiratory status, and rapidly decreased viral burden in respiratory fluids and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Longitudinal unbiased proteomic analysis of plasma and single-cell transcriptomics of peripheral blood cells conducted prior to and at multiple times after convalescent plasma transfusion identified the key biological processes associated with the transition from severe disease to disease-free state. These included (i) temporally ordered upward and downward changes in plasma proteins reestablishing homeostasis and (ii) post-transfusion disappearance of a particular subset of dysfunctional monocytes characterized by hyperactivated Interferon responses and decreased TNF-α signaling.Conclusions Monitoring specific subsets of innate immune cells in peripheral blood may provide prognostic keys in severe COVID-19. Moreover, understanding disease resolution at the molecular and cellular level should contribute to identify targets of therapeutic interventions against severe COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementRutgers University has filed for patent protection for various aspects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection and its uses.

%X Laboratory tests for the accurate and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants can potentially guide the treatment of COVID-19 patients and inform infection control and public health surveillance efforts. Here we present the development and validation of a rapid COVID-19 variant DETECTR® assay incorporating loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) followed by CRISPR-Cas12 based identification of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene. This assay targets the L452R, E484K/Q/A, and N501Y mutations that are associated with nearly all circulating viral lineages and identifies the two circulating variants of concern, Delta and Omicron. In a comparison of three different Cas12 enzymes, only the newly identified enzyme CasDx1 was able to accurately identify all targeted SNP mutations. An analysis pipeline for CRISPR-based SNP identification from 139 clinical samples yielded an overall SNP concordance of 98% and agreement with SARS-CoV-2 lineage classification of 138/139 compared to viral whole-genome sequencing. We also showed that detection of the single E484A mutation was necessary and sufficient to accurately identify Omicron from other major circulating variants in patient samples. These findings demonstrate the utility of CRISPR-based DETECTR® as a faster and simpler diagnostic than sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 variant identification in clinical and public health laboratories.Competing Interest StatementC.Y.C. is the director of the UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center and receives research support from Abbott Laboratories, Inc.

%X From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for diagnostic and screening tests has exceeded supply. Although the proportion of vaccinated people has increased in wealthier countries, breakthrough infections have occurred amid the emergence of new variants. Pooled-sample COVID-19 testing using saliva has been proposed as an efficient, inexpensive, and non-invasive method to allow larger-scale testing, especially in a screening setting. In this study, we aimed to evaluate pooled RT-qPCR saliva testing and to compare the results with individual tests.Employees of Philips Japan, Ltd. were recruited to participate in COVID-19 screening from October to December 2020. Asymptomatic individuals (n=824) submitted self-collected saliva samples. Samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in both 10-sample pools and individual tests. We also surveyed participants regarding their thoughts and behaviors after the PCR screening project.Two of the 824 individuals were positive by RT-qPCR. In the pooled testing, one of these two had no measurable Ct value, but showed an amplification trend at the end of the PCR cycle. Both positive individuals developed cold-like symptoms, but neither required hospitalization. Of the 824 participants, 471 responded to our online questionnaire. Overall, while respondents agreed that PCR screening should be performed regularly, the majority were willing to undergo PCR testing only when it was provided for free or at low cost.In conclusion, pooled testing of saliva samples can support frequent large-scale screening that is rapid, efficient, and inexpensive.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was partially supported by the Keio University Global Research Institute (KGRI) Research Projects for New Coronavirus Crisis: Implementation of a Keio Model to Optimize SARS-CoV-2 PCR Tests through Systems Approach (PI: Koichi Matsuo), the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (PI: Hiroshi Nishihara, Grant Number 20he1422004j0001), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) of JSPS KAKENHI (PI: Junna Oba, Grant Number JP21K10334), and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT) for utilization of the university?s PCR equipment.

%X Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a promising tool to monitor pathogens in a population, particularly when clinical diagnostic capacities become overwhelmed. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), several jurisdictions have tracked viral concentrations in wastewater to inform public health authorities. While some studies have also sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from wastewater, there have been relatively few direct comparisons between viral genetic diversity in wastewater and matched clinical samples from the same region and time period. Here we report sequencing and inference of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variant lineages (including variants of concern) in 936 wastewater samples and thousands of matched clinical sequences collected between March 2020 and July 2021 in the cities of Montreal, Quebec City, and Laval, representing almost half the population of the Canadian province of Quebec. We benchmarked our sequencing and variant-calling methods on known viral genome sequences to establish thresholds for inferring variants in wastewater with confidence. We found that variant frequency estimates in wastewater and clinical samples are correlated over time in each city, with similar dates of first detection. Across all variant lineages, wastewater detection is more concordant with targeted outbreak sequencing than with semi-random clinical swab sampling. Most variants were first observed in clinical and outbreak data due to higher sequencing rate. However, wastewater sequencing is highly efficient, detecting more variants for a given sampling effort. This shows the potential for wastewater sequencing to provide useful public health data, especially at places or times when sufficient clinical sampling is infrequent or infeasible.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) operating grant to the Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network (CoVaRR-Net) to JR and BJS and the CFI project 'High throughput SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing at the McGill Genome Center' to JR.

%X While mass gathering events have resumed in conjunction with vaccine-testing (VT) packages, their effects on reducing COVID-19 risk remain unclear. Here, we used an environmental exposure model to analyze the effects of vaccinations and proof of negative test results on reducing infection risk and serious illness among spectators at mass gathering events. We then analyzed the difference in risk with and without VT and regular seat zoning. Risk of infection and serious illness were quantified using a model incorporating parameters such as vaccination coverage, vaccine prevention effectiveness, and sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or qualitative antigen tests. When vaccine prevention effectiveness was 50% (corresponding to 4 months for the delta variant and 1–2 months for the omicron variant after the second vaccine dose), the risk of infection and serious illness among vaccinated spectators were 0.32–0.40 and 0.13–0.16 times of those who tested negative, respectively. In contrast, the risks of infection and serious illness among vaccinated spectators without measures such as mask wearing were 4.0 and 1.6 times higher than those among unvaccinated spectators with such measures, respectively. The risk of infection with an 80% vaccination coverage and a vaccine prevention effectiveness of 20% (corresponding to 5–6 months for the delta variant or 3–4 months for the omicron variant after the second vaccine dose) was comparable to that of a 20% vaccine coverage and a vaccine prevention effectiveness of 80% (corresponding to 1–3 months for delta variant after the second vaccine dose). Regarding zoning, there was little difference in risk with a vaccination coverage of ≥80%. Adherence to individual measures after vaccination and maintenance of high vaccine effectiveness among spectators at stadiums are important for reducing risk of infection and serious illness. Furthermore, seat zoning did not affect overall infection risk reduction.Competing Interest StatementSupport for the reported work: This research received no external financial or non-financial support.

%X Introduction The waning of the antibody titre after the first two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was reported. However, knowledge of the dynamics of cellular immunity is scarce. Here, we performed a prospective cohort study to disclose antibody and cellular immunity dynamics and discuss the relationship between immunity and breakthrough infection.Methods The study had a prospective cohort design. Antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 in serially collected serum samples of 608 Japanese vaccinees after 6 months of vaccination were measured. Simultaneously, T-cell immunity dynamics were assessed using the QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay. Additionally, participants with suspected breakthrough infection were detected according to the positive conversion of the IgG assay for nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2.Results Antibody titres were elevated 3 weeks after vaccination and waned over the remainder of the study period. The QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay performed on 536 participants demonstrated the similar dynamics. Six participants without predisposing medical conditions demonstrated positive conversion of the IgG assay for nucleocapsid proteins, while five were asymptomatic.Conclusion Waning of humoral and cellular immunity within 6 months of administration of two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine among Japanese healthcare professionals and the occurrence of asymptomatic breakthrough infection was suspected in approximately 1 of 100 vaccinees.(UMIN000043340)Competing Interest StatementYU, MW, and MM own patents for the STACIA SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Test.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant is rapidly spreading worldwide, possibly outcompeting the Delta strain. We investigated the empirical serial interval for both variants using contact tracing data. Overall, we observed a shorter serial interval for Omicron compared to Delta, suggesting faster transmission. Furthermore, results indicate a relation between the empirical serial interval and the vaccination status for both the Omicron and the Delta variant. Consequently, with the progression of the vaccination campaign, the reasons for and extent of dominance of Omicron over Delta may need further assessment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementN.H. and A.T. acknowledge funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme - project EpiPose (Grant agreement number 101003688).

%X Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic nasopharyngeal or nose/throat swabs (NTS) have been the primary approach for collecting patient samples for the subsequent detection of viral RNA. However, this procedure, if undertaken correctly, can be unpleasant and therefore deters individuals from providing high quality samples. To overcome these limitations other modes of sample collection have been explored. In a cohort of frontline healthcare workers we have compared saliva and gargle samples to gold-standard NTS. 93% of individuals preferred providing saliva or gargle samples, with little sex-dependent variation. Viral titres collected in samples were analysed using standard methods and showed that gargle and saliva were similarly comparable for identifying COVID-19 positive individuals compared to NTS (92% sensitivity; 98% specificity). We suggest that gargle and saliva collection are viable alternatives to NTS swabs and may encourage testing to provide better disease diagnosis and population surveillance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by NHS Lothian and the UK Medical Research CouncilAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:NHS Lothian Ethics Panel approved this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant has led to growing concerns of increased transmissibility and escape of both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. In this analysis, sera from adult participants in a phase 2 clinical study (NCT04405076) were tested for neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529 after a 2-dose (100 µg) mRNA-1273 primary vaccination series and after a 50-µg mRNA-1273 booster dose. Results from this preliminary analysis show that 1 month after completing the primary series, mRNA-1273-elicited serum neutralization of B.1.1.529 was below the lower limit of quantification; however, neutralization was observed at 2 weeks after the mRNA-1273 booster dose, although at a reduced level relative to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) and lower than that observed against D614G at 1 month after the primary series.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are employees of Moderna Inc., and hold stock/stock options from the company.Funding StatementThis research was supported by Moderna Inc., and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Department of Health and Human Services (contract 75A50120C00034).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All participants provided informed consent and all study materials were approved by a central institutional review board (Advarra; Columbia, Maryland); the study was conducted in accordance with the International Council on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice guidelines.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The magnitude of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) global spread necessitates reinforcement of surveillance implementation. Conventional VOC surveillance based on genotyping of clinical samples is characterized by certain challenges related to available sequencing capacity, population sampling methodologies, and demands in terms of time, labor, and resources. Wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 VOC surveillance constitutes a valuable supplementary practice, since it does not require extensive sampling, and provides information on the prevalence of the disease in a timely and cost-effective manner.Methods A highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR assay was developed, for targeted Omicron VOC detection and quantification in wastewater samples. The assay exclusively amplifies sequences with the S:Δ69/70 deletion, thus its performance is not hampered by the presence of the Delta VOC. The method was incorporated in the analysis of composite daily samples taken from the main Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) of Thessaloniki, Greece from 1 December 2021 to 9 January 2022.Results The Omicron VOC was detected for the first time in samples from the Thessaloniki WWTP on 19 December 2021. In the following 10-day period, a rapid increase in Omicron sewage viral load was observed with an estimated early doubling time of 1.86 days. The proportion of the total SARS-CoV-2 load attributed to Omicron reached 91.09% on 7 January, revealing a fast Delta-to-Omicron VOC transition pattern. The detection of Omicron in wastewater preceded the outburst of reported (presumable) Omicron cases in the city by approximately 7 days.Conclusions The proposed wastewater-based surveillance approach enables rapid, real-time data acquisition on the Omicron VOC prevalence and transmission dynamics. Timely provision of these results to State authorities can readily influence the decision-making process for targeted public health interventions, including control measures, awareness, and preparedness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The entire study has been approved by the AUTH Research Ethics Committee, with reference number 25263/2022.

%X Background The use of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (CoronaVac) against SARS-CoV-2 is implemented worldwide. However, waning immunity and breakthrough infections have been observed. Therefore, we hypothesized that the heterologous booster might improve the protection against the delta and omicron variants.Methods A total of 224 individuals who completed the two-dose CoronaVac for six months were included. We studied reactogenicity and immunogenicity following a heterologous booster with the inactivated vaccine (BBIBP), the viral vector vaccine (AZD1222), and the mRNA vaccine (both BNT162B2 and mRNA-1273). We also determined immunogenicity at 3- and 6-months boosting intervals.Results The solicited adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate and well-tolerated. Total RBD immunoglobulin (Ig), anti-RBD IgG, focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) against delta and omicron variants, and T cell response were highest in the mRNA-1273 group followed by the BNT162b2, AZD1222 and BBIBP groups, respectively. We also witnessed a higher total Ig anti-RBD in the long-interval than in the short-interval groups.Conclusions All four booster vaccines significantly increased binding and NAbs in individuals immunized with two doses of CoronaVac. The present evidence may benefit vaccine strategies development to thwart variants of concern, including the omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR 20210910002)Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI), National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Chulalongkorn University, and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital and was partially supported by the Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University.

%X SARS-CoV-2 is still a major burden for global health despite effective vaccines. With the reduction of social distancing measures, infection rates are increasing in children, while data on the pediatric immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still lacking. Although the typical disease course in children has been mild, emerging variants may present new challenges in this age group.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 51 convalescent children, 24 seronegative siblings from early 2020, and 51 unexposed controls were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide MegaPools from the ancestral and beta variants. Flow cytometric determination of activation-induced markers and secreted cytokines were used to quantify the CD4+ T cell response.The average time after infection was over 80 days. CD4+ T cell responses were detected in 61% of convalescent children and were markedly reduced in preschool children. Cross-reactive T cells for the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant were identified in 45% of cases after infection with an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variant. The CD4+ T cell response was accompanied most predominantly by IFN-γ and Granzyme B secretion.An antiviral CD4+ T cell response was present in children after ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was reduced in the youngest age group. We detected significant cross-reactivity of CD4+ T cell responses to the more recently evolved immune-escaping beta variant. Our findings have epidemiologic relevance for children regarding novel viral variants of concern and vaccination efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe C19.CHILD Hamburg Study received funding from the Senate Chancellery of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.

%X Regional connectivity and land-based travel have been identified as important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the generalizability of this finding is understudied outside of well-sampled, highly connected regions such as Europe. In this study, we investigated the relative contributions of regional and intercontinental connectivity to the source-sink dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 for Jordan and the wider Middle East. By integrating genomic, epidemiological and travel data we show that the source of introductions into Jordan was dynamic across 2020, shifting from intercontinental seeding from Europe in the early pandemic to more regional seeding for the period travel restrictions were in place. We show that land-based travel, particularly freight transport, drove introduction risk during the period of travel restrictions. Consistently, high regional connectivity and land-based travel also disproportionately drove Jordan’s export risk to other Middle Eastern countries. Our findings emphasize regional connectedness and land-based travel as drivers of viral transmission in the Middle East. This demonstrates that strategies aiming to stop or slow the spread of viral introductions (including new variants) with travel restrictions need to prioritize risk from land-based travel alongside intercontinental air travel to be effective.HighlightsRegional connectivity drove SARS-CoV-2 introduction risk in Jordan during the period travel restrictions were in place in genomic and travel data.Land-based travel rather than air travel disproportionately drove introduction risk during travel restrictions.High regional connectivity disproportionately drove Jordan’s export risk, with significant contribution from land-based travel.Regional transmission dynamics were underestimated in genomic data due to unrepresentative sampling.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work has been funded by CDC BAA contracts 75D30120C09795 (K.G.A.), NIH NIAID 3U19AI135995-03S2 (K.G.A.), U19AI135995 (K.G.A.), U01AI151812 (K.G.A.), NIH NCATS UL1TR002550 (K.G.A.), NIH NIAID R01 AI135992 (J.O.W).

%X Patients with primary antibody deficiency syndromes (PAD) have poor humoral immune responses requiring immunoglobulin replacement therapy. We followed PAD patients after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by evaluating their immunoglobulin replacement products and serum for anti-spike binding, FcγR binding, and neutralizing activities. Immunoglobulin replacement products had low anti-spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) titers and neutralizing activity. In COVID-19-naive PAD patients, anti-spike and RBD titers increased after mRNA vaccination but decreased to pre-immunization levels by 90 days. Patients vaccinated after SARS-CoV-2 infection developed higher responses comparable to healthy donors. Most vaccinated PAD patients had serum neutralizing antibody titers above an estimated correlate of protection against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Delta virus but not against Omicron virus, although this was improved by boosting. Thus, currently used immunoglobulin replacement products likely have limited protective activity, and immunization and boosting of PAD patients with mRNA vaccines should confer at least short-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron.Competing Interest StatementM.S.D. is a consultant for Inbios, Vir Biotechnology, Senda Biosciences, and Carnival Corporation, and on the Scientific Advisory Boards of Moderna and Immunome.

%X Following the identification of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in late November 2021, governments worldwide took actions intended to minimize the impact of the new variant within their borders. Despite guidance from the World Health Organization advising a risk-based approach, many rapidly implemented stringent policies focused on travel restrictions. In this paper, we capture 221 national-level travel policies issued during the three weeks following publicization of the Omicron variant. We characterize policies based upon whether they target travelers from specific countries or focus more broadly on enhanced screening, and explore differences in approaches at the regional level. We find that initial reactions almost universally focused on entry bans and flight suspensions from Southern Africa, and that policies continued to target travel from these countries even after community transmission of the Omicron variant was detected elsewhere in the world. While layered testing and quarantine requirements were implemented by some countries later in this three-week period, these enhanced screening policies were rarely the first response. The timing and conditionality of quarantine and testing requirements were not coordinated between countries or regions, creating logistical complications and burdening travelers with costs. Overall, response measures were rarely tied to specific criteria or adapted to match the unique epidemiology of the new variant.Summary boxDuring the initial three-week period following the discovery of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, nations rushed to implement travel restrictions - often at odds with guidance from the World Health Organization.By sourcing and cataloging initial national-level travel restrictions worldwide, we demonstrate how the distribution of entry bans, flight suspensions, quarantine measures, vaccination requirements, and testing protocols evolved in response to emerging information during a period of uncertainty.Countries that issued entry bans almost universally targeted the same Southern African countries and continued to do so even after widespread community transmission of the Omicron variant was reported elsewhere in the world.Layers of testing and quarantine requirements were added later during the observation period but were rarely the initial response, with the exception of restrictions issued by countries in Africa, where leading with enhanced screening measures was more common.Analysis of the disconnect between travel restrictions and transmission patterns that followed emergence of the Omicron variant provides a basis to inform evidence-based control measures for future virus mitigation efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study received funding from The Rockefeller Foundation, Google Health, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and Open Philanthropy.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BBV152/Covaxin is well-tolerated and was shown to be 77.8% efficacious against symptomatic and 93.4% efficacious against severe symptomatic COVID-19 disease in adults. Previous studies have shown that sera from Covaxin vaccinated individuals have neutralizing activity against B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.1.28 (Zeta), and B.1.617.1 (Kappa) SARS-CoV-2 variants. The B.1.1.529 variant (Omicron) recently emerged in November 2021 and has spread throughout the world. The Omicron variant has more than 30 mutations within the spike protein that could impact vaccine-mediated immunity. We used a live virus neutralization assay to evaluate the neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant of sera collected from subjects who received a booster dose (6-month after primary series last dose) of Covaxin. We found that sera from Covaxin boosted individuals showed neutralizing activity against D614G (vaccine strain), Delta, and Omicron variants. One hundred percent of boosted subjects showed neutralizing activity against the Delta variant while over 90% of boosted subjects showed neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant. These findings show that a booster dose of Covaxin can generate robust neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementM.S.S has an advisory role with Ocugen and Moderna.Clinical TrialNCT04471519Funding StatementThis work was sponsored by Ocugen, Inc., Malvern, USA, and serum samples were provided by Bharat Biotech India Limited, Hyderabad, India.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:ECR/303/Inst/AP/2013/RR-19 of Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad gave ethical approval for this work 2.ECR/495/Inst/HR/2013/RR-20 of Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences Rohtak gave ethical approval for this work 3.ECR/1387/Inst/BR/2020 of All India Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna gave ethical approval for this work 4.ECR/902/Inst/GA/2018 of Redkar Hospital and Research center, Goa gave ethical approval for this work 5.ECR/1374/Inst/MH/2020 of Gillurkar Multispecialty Hospitals, Nagpur gave ethical approval for this work 6.ECR/1017/Inst/UP/2017/RR-21 of Prakhar Hospital Private Limited, Kanpur gave ethical approval for this work 7.ECR/431/Inst/TN/2013/RR-19 of SRM Medical College Hospital &amp; Research Center, Tamil Nadu gave ethical approval for this work 8.ECR/1242/Inst/KA/2019 of Jeevan Rekha Hospital, Belagavi gave ethical approval for this work 9.ECR/538/Inst/DL/2014/RR-20 of All India Medical Sciences, New Delhi gave ethical approval for this work.

%X Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) infections are rapidly expanding worldwide, often in settings where the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was dominant. We investigated whether neutralizing immunity elicited by Omicron infection would also neutralize the Delta variant and the role of prior vaccination. We enrolled 23 South African participants infected with Omicron a median of 5 days post-symptoms onset (study baseline) with a last follow-up sample taken a median of 23 days post-symptoms onset. Ten participants were breakthrough cases vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2 or Johnson and Johnson Ad26.CoV2.S. In vaccinated participants, neutralization of Omicron increased from a geometric mean titer (GMT) FRNT50 of 28 to 378 (13.7-fold). Unvaccinated participants had similar Omicron neutralization at baseline but increased from 26 to only 113 (4.4-fold) at follow-up. Delta virus neutralization increased from 129 to 790, (6.1-fold) in vaccinated but only 18 to 46 (2.5-fold, not statistically significant) in unvaccinated participants. Therefore, in Omicron infected vaccinated individuals, Delta neutralization was 2.1-fold higher at follow-up relative to Omicron. In a separate group previously infected with Delta, neutralization of Delta was 22.5-fold higher than Omicron. Based on relative neutralization levels, Omicron re-infection would be expected to be more likely than Delta in Delta infected individuals, and in Omicron infected individuals who are vaccinated. This may give Omicron an advantage over Delta which may lead to decreasing Delta infections in regions with high infection frequencies and high vaccine coverage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates award INV-018944 (AS), National Institutes of Health award R01 AI138546 (AS), and South African Medical Research Council awards (AS, TdO, PLM) and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Wellcome Trust (Grant no 221003/Z/20/Z, PLM).

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has a growth advantage over the Delta variant, due to higher transmissibility, immune evasion, or a shorter serial interval. Using S-gene target failure (SGTF) as indication for Omicron BA.1, we identify 908 SGTF and 1621 non-SGTF serial intervals in the same period. Within households, we find that the mean serial interval for SGTF cases is 0.2-0.6 days shorter than for non-SGTF cases. This suggests that the growth advantage of Omicron is partly due to a shorter serial interval.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was financed by the Netherlands Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.

%T A Quick Displacement of the SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta with Omicron: Unprecedented Spike in COVID-19 Cases Associated with Fewer Admissions and Comparable Upper Respiratory Viral Loads

%X Background The increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in December 2021 in the United States was driven primarily by the Omicron variant which largely displaced the Delta over a three week span. Outcomes from infection with the Omicron remain uncertain. We evaluate whether clinical outcomes and viral loads differ between Delta and Omicron infections during the period when both variants were co-circulating.Methods Remnant clinical specimens from patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after standard of care testing between the last week of November and the end of December 2021were used for whole viral genome sequencing. Cycle threshold values (Ct) for viral RNA, the presence of infectious virus, and levels of respiratory IgG were measured, and clinical outcomes were obtained. Differences in each measure were compared between variants stratified by vaccination status.Results The Omicron variant displaced the Delta during the study period and constituted 95% of the circulating lineages by the end of December 2021. Patients with Omicron infections (N= 1121) were more likely to be vaccinated compared to patients with Delta (N = 910), but were less likely to be admitted, require ICU level care, or succumb to infection regardless of vaccination status. There was no significant difference in Ct values based on the lineage regardless of the vaccination status. Recovery of infectious virus in cell culture was reduced in boosted patients compared to fully vaccinated without a booster and unvaccinated when infected with the Delta lineage. However, in patients with Omicron infections, recovery of infectious virus was not affected by vaccination.Conclusions Omicron infections of vaccinated individuals are expected, yet admissions are less frequent. Admitted patients might develop severe disease comparable to Delta. Efforts for reducing the Omicron transmission are required as even though the admission risk is lower, the numbers of infections continue to be high.Research in context Evidence before this study The unprecedented increase in COVID-19 cases in the month of December 2021, associated with the displacement of the Delta variant with the Omicron, triggered a lot of concerns. An understanding of the disease severity associated with infections with Omicron is essential as well as the virological determinants that contributed to its widespread predominance. We searched PubMed for articles published up to January 23, 2022, using the search terms (“Omicron”) AND (“Disease severity”) as well as (“Omicron”) AND (“Viral load”) And/ or (“Cell culture”). Our search yielded 3 main studies that directly assessed the omicron’s clinical severity in South Africa, its infectious viral load compared to Delta, and the dynamics of viral RNA shedding. In South Africa, compared to Delta, Omicron infected patients showed a significant reduction in severe disease. In this study, Omicron and non-Omicron variants were characterized based on S gene target failure using the TaqPath COVID-19 PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In the study from Switzerland that assessed the infectious viral load in Omicron versus Delta, the authors analyzed only 18 Omicron samples that were all from vaccinated individuals to show that compared to Delta, Omicron had equivalent infectious viral titers. The third study that assessed the Omicron viral dynamics showed that the peak viral RNA in Omicron infections is lower than Delta. No published studies assessed the clinical discrepancies of Omicron and Delta infected patients from the US, nor comprehensively assessed, by viral load and cell culture studies, the characteristics of both variants stratified by vaccination status.Added value of this study To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study to date to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes after infection with the Omicron variant compared to Delta in the US using variants characterized by whole genome sequencing and a selective time frame when both variant co-circulated. It is also the first study to stratify the analysis based on the vaccination status and to compare fully vaccinated patients who didn’t receive a booster vaccination to patients who received a booster vaccination. In addition, we provide a unique viral RNA and infectious virus load analyses to compare Delta and Omicron samples from unvaccinated, fully vaccinated, and patients with booster vaccination.Implications of all the available evidence Omicron associated with a significant increase in infections in fully and booster vaccinated individuals but with less admissions and ICU level care. Admitted patients showed similar requirements for supplemental oxygen and ICU level care when compared to Delta admitted patients. Viral loads were similar in samples from Omicron and Delta infected patients regardless of the vaccination status. The recovery of infectious virus on cell culture was reduced in samples from patients infected with Delta who received a booster dose, but this was not the case with Omicron. The recovery of infectious virus was equivalent in Omicron infected unvaccinated, fully vaccinated, and samples from patients who received booster vaccination.Funding NIH/NIAID Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance contract HHS N2772201400007C, Johns Hopkins University, Maryland department of health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contract 75D30121C11061.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNIH/NIAID Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance contract HHS N2772201400007C, Johns Hopkins University, Maryland department of health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contract 75D30121C11061Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The research Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Institutional Review Board-X (JHM IRB-X) is constituted to meet the requirements of the Privacy Rule at section 45 CFR 164.512(i)(1)(i)(B) and is authorized and qualified to serve as the Privacy Board for human subjects research applications conducted by Johns Hopkins University faculty members.

%X NDV-HXP-S is a recombinant Newcastle disease virus based-vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which expresses an optimized (HexaPro) spike protein on its surface. The vaccine can be produced in embryonated chicken eggs using the same process as that employed for the production of influenza virus vaccines. Here we performed a secondary analysis of the antibody responses after vaccination with inactivated NDV-HXP-S in a Phase I clinical study in Thailand.The SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing and spike binding activity of NDV-HXP-S post-vaccination serum samples was compared to that of matched samples from mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccinees. Neutralizing activity of sera from NDV-HXP-S vaccinees was comparable to that of individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2. Interstingly, the spike binding activity of the NDV-HXP-S vaccinee samples was lower than that of sera obtained from individuals vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine. This let us to calculate ratios between binding and neutralizing antibody titers. Samples from NDV-HXP-S vaccinees had binding to neutralizing activity ratios similar to those of convalescent sera suggesting a very high proportion of neutralizing antibodies and low non-neutralizing antibody titers. Further analysis showed that, in contrast to mRNA vaccination, which induces strong antibody titers to the receptor binding domain (RBD), the N-terminal domain, and the S2 domain, NDV-HXP-S vaccination induces a very RBD focused response with little reactivity to S2. This explains the high proportion of neutralizing antibodies since most neutralizing epitopes are located in the RBD. In conclusion, vaccination with inactivated NDV-HXP-S induces a high proportion of neutralizing antibodies and absolute neutralizing antibody titers comparable to those after mRNA vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe vaccine administered in this study was developed by faculty members at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai including FK, AGS, PP, and WS.

%X Background The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is now overtaking the Delta variant in many countries. Results showing that sera from double vaccinated individuals have minimal neutralizing activity against Omicron may indicate that the higher rate of transmission is due to evasion from vaccine-induced immunity. However, there is little information about activation of recall responses to Omicron in vaccinated individuals.Methods We measured inflammatory mediators, antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, and spike peptide-induced release of interferon gamma in whole blood in 51 vaccinated individuals infected with Omicron, in 14 infected with Delta, and in 18 healthy controls. The median time points for the first and second samples were 7 and 14 days after symptom onset, respectively.Findings Infection with Omicron or Delta led to a rapid and similar increase in antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins and spike peptide-induced interferon gamma in whole blood. Both the Omicron and the Delta infected patients had a mild and transient increase in inflammatory parameters.Interpretation The results suggest that vaccine-induced immunological memory yields similar coverage for the Omicron and Delta variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study received the following funding: Oslo University Hospital (JCH, FM), Research Council of Norway (grant no 312780 to JCH, SD; 324274 to AS), The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (FL-J), South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (2019067 and 2021071 to BH; 2021047 and 33612 to AS; 2021087 to GG; 10357 to FL-J, JTA; 2017092 to JAD), EU Horizon 2020 (848099 to BH), The European Virus Archive GLOBAL (EVA-GLOBAL) project that has received funding from the European UnioWs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no $71029 (MK), and a philantropic donation from Vivaldi Invest A/S owned by Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner (JCH).

%X SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces robust humoral and cellular immunity in the circulation; however, it is currently unknown whether it elicits effective immune responses in the respiratory tract, particularly against variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 S-specific total and neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses, and B and T cell immunity, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and blood of COVID-19 vaccinated individuals and hospitalized patients. Vaccinated individuals had significantly lower levels of neutralizing Ab against D614G, Delta and Omicron in the BAL compared to COVID-19 convalescents, despite robust S-specific Ab responses in the blood. Further, mRNA vaccination induced significant circulating S-specific B and T cell immunity, but in contrast to COVID-19 convalescents, these responses were absent in the BAL of vaccinated individuals. Using an animal immunization model, we demonstrate that systemic mRNA vaccination alone induced weak respiratory mucosal neutralizing Ab responses, especially against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; however, a combination of systemic mRNA vaccination plus mucosal adenovirus-S immunization induced strong neutralizing Ab response, not only against the ancestral virus but also the Omicron variant. Together, our study supports the contention that the current COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against severe disease development, likely through recruiting circulating B and T cell responses during re-infection, but offer limited protection against breakthrough infection, especially by Omicron. Hence, mucosal booster vaccination is needed to establish robust sterilizing immunity in the respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2, including infection by Omicron and future variants.Competing Interest StatementJ.S. is a consultant for the Teneofour company, which does not directly involve with this project.Funding StatementAI147394, AG047156 and AG069264 to J.S.; AI147394S1 to J.S., an anonymous private donor to The Ohio State University and NCI U54CA260582, NIH R01 AI150473. to S.-L.L., M.H.K. was supported by AI057459; H.H. was supported by AI147903 and AI157852Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Boards, IRB protocol # 19-012187.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Understanding and measuring the individual level of immune protection and its persistence at both humoral and cellular levels after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is mandatory for the management of the vaccination booster campaign. Our prospective study was designed to assess the immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in triggering the humoral and the cellular immune response in healthcare workers up to 6 months after two doses vaccination.Methods This prospective study enrolled 208 healthcare workers from the Liège University Hospital (CHU) of Liège in Belgium. All participants received two doses of BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2). Fifty participants were SARS-CoV-2 experienced (self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection) and 158 were naïve (no reported SARS-CoV-2 infection) before the vaccination. Blood sampling was performed at the day of the first (T0) and second (T1) vaccine doses administration, then at 2 weeks (T2), 4 weeks (T3) and 6 months (T4) after the 1st vaccine dose administration. A total of 1024 blood samples were collected. All samples were tested for the presence of anti-Spike antibodies using DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay. Neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-like variant strain were quantified in all samples using a Vero E6 cell-based neutralization-based assay. Cell-mediated immune response was evaluated at T4 on 80 participants by measuring the secretion of IFN-γ on peripheral blood lymphocytes using the QuantiFERON Human IFN-γ SARS-CoV-2, Qiagen. All participants were monitored on weekly-basis for the novo SARS-COV-2 infection for 4 weeks after the 1st vaccine dose administration. We analyzed separately the naïve and experienced participants.Findings We found that anti-spike antibodies and neutralization capacity levels were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 experienced healthcare workers (HCWs) compared to naïve HCWs at all time points analyzed. Cellular immune response was similar in the two groups six months following 2nd dose of the vaccine. Reassuringly, most participants had a detectable cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 six months after vaccination. Besides the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection history on immune response to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, we observed a significant negative correlation between age and persistence of humoral response. Cellular immune response was, however, not significantly correlated to age, although a trend towards a negative impact of age was observed.Conclusions Our data strengthen previous findings demonstrating that immunization through vaccination combined with natural infection is better than 2 vaccine doses immunization or natural infection alone. It may have implications for personalizing mRNA vaccination regimens used to prevent severe COVID-19 and reduce the impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system. More specifically, it may help prioritizing vaccination, including for the deployment of booster doses.Competing Interest StatementFB and LG are the inventors of the device used in the saliva collection kit.

%X Vaccines based on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are a cornerstone of the public health response to COVID-19. The emergence of hypermutated, increasingly transmissible variants of concern (VOCs) threaten this strategy. Omicron, the fifth VOC to be described, harbours 30 amino acid mutations in spike including 15 in the receptor-binding domain. Here, we demonstrate substantial evasion of neutralisation by Omicron in vitro using sera from vaccinated individuals. Importantly, these data are mirrored by a substantial reduction in real-world vaccine effectiveness that is partially restored by booster vaccination. We also demonstrate that Omicron does not induce cell syncytia and favours a TMPRSS2-independent endosomal entry pathway. Such marked changes in antigenicity and replicative biology may underlie the rapid global spread and altered pathogenicity of the Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe EVADE study is supported by HDR-UK (E.C.T).

%X Background Solid organ transplant recipients have attenuated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Emerging evidence suggests at least equivalent immunogenicity of heterologous compared with homologous vaccine regimens in the general population. In this study, we report on immune responses to 3rd dose BNT162b2 vaccines in transplant recipients either primed with ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2.Methods 700 kidney transplant recipients were prospectively screened for serological responses (median time of 33 (21-52) days) following 3 primary doses of a SARS-CoV2 vaccine. All vaccine doses were received post-transplant, and all 3rd doses were BNT162b2. All participants had serological testing performed post-2nd vaccination at a median time of 34 (IQR 26-46) days following the 2nd inoculation, and at least once prior to their 1st dose of vaccine.Results 366/700 (52.3%) participants were primed with BNT162b2, whilst 334/700 (47.7) had received ChAdOx1. Overall, 139/700 (19.9%) participants had evidence of prior infection. Of 561 infection naïve participants, 263 (46.9%) had no detectable anti-S following 2-doses of vaccine (V2). 134 (23.9%) participants remained seronegative post 3rd vaccine (V3); 54/291 (18.6%) and 79/270 (29.3%) of participants receiving BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 respectively, p=0.0029. Median anti-S concentrations were significantly higher post-V3 in patients who had received BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1, at 612 (27-234) versus 122 (7.1-1111) BAU/ml respectively, p&lt;0.0001.Cellular responses were investigated in 30 infection naïve participants at a median time of 35 (24-46) days post-V3. Eighteen of 30 (60.0%) participants had undetectable T-cell responses. There were neither qualitative or quantitative differences in T-cell responses between those patients who received BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 as their first 2-doses, with 10/16 (62.5%) and 8/14 (57.1%) respectively having undetectable T-cell responses, p=0.77.Conclusion A significant proportion of transplant recipients remain seronegative following 3 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with anti-S concentrations lower in patients receiving heterologous versus homologous vaccinations.Competing Interest StatementMW and PK have received study support from OxfordImmunotecFunding StatementThis research is supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre based at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Imperial College London.

%X Although mRNA vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 remains high, variant emergence and breakthrough infections have changed vaccine policy to include booster immunizations. However, the effect of diverse and repeated antigen exposures on SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells is poorly understood. Here, we utilize DNA-barcoded MHC-multimers combined with scRNAseq and scTCRseq to capture the ex vivo profile of SARS-CoV-2-responsive T cells within a cohort of individuals with one, two, or three antigen exposures, including vaccination, primary infection, and breakthrough infection. We found that the order of exposure determined the relative distribution between spike- and non-spike-specific responses, with vaccination after infection leading to further expansion of spike-specific T cells and differentiation to a CCR7-CD45RA+ effector phenotype. In contrast, individuals experiencing a breakthrough infection mount vigorous non-spike-specific responses. In-depth analysis of over 4,000 epitope-specific T cell receptor sequences demonstrates that all types of exposures elicit diverse repertoires characterized by shared, dominant TCR motifs, with no evidence for repertoire narrowing from repeated exposure. Our findings suggest that breakthrough infections diversify the T cell memory repertoire and that current vaccination protocols continue to expand and differentiate spike-specific memory responses.Competing Interest StatementP.G.T has consulted or received honorarium and travel support from Illumina and 10X.

%X SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells are likely important in immunity against COVID-19, but our understanding of CD4+ longitudinal dynamics following infection and specific features that correlate with the maintenance of neutralizing antibodies remains limited. We characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in a longitudinal cohort of 109 COVID-19 outpatients. The quality of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ response shifted from cells producing IFNγ to TNFα+ from five days to four months post-enrollment, with IFNγ-IL21-TNFα+ CD4+ T cells the predominant population detected at later timepoints. Greater percentages of IFNγ-IL21-TNFα+ CD4+ T cells on day 28 correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies measured seven months post-infection (ρ=0.4, P=0.01). mRNA vaccination following SARS-CoV-2 infection boosted both IFNγ and TNFα producing, spike protein-specific CD4+ T cells. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific, TNFα-producing CD4+ T cells may play an important role in antibody maintenance following COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04331899; IND 419217Funding StatementThis study was funded by NIH/NIAID (U01 AI150741-01S1, UL1 TR001085), the Stanfords Innovative Medicines Accelerator (Chem-H IMA), and a Fastgrant.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Stanford University (protocol 57230)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Virus-like particle (VLP) and live virus assays were used to investigate neutralizing immunity to Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants in 239 samples from 125 fully vaccinated individuals. In uninfected, non-boosted individuals, VLP neutralization titers to Delta and Omicron were reduced 2.7-fold and 15.4-fold, respectively, compared to wild-type (WT), while boosted individuals (n=23) had 18-fold increased titers. Delta breakthrough infections (n=39) had 57-fold and 3.1-fold titers whereas Omicron breakthrough infections (n=14) had 5.8-fold and 0.32-fold titers compared to uninfected non-boosted and boosted individuals, respectively. The difference in titers (p=0.049) was related to a higher proportion of moderate to severe infections in the Delta cohort (p=0.014). Correlation of neutralizing and spike quantitative antibody titers was decreased with Delta or Omicron compared to WT. Neutralizing antibodies in Delta and Omicron breakthrough infections increase overall, but the relative magnitude of increase is greater in more clinically severe infection and against the specific infecting variant.Competing Interest StatementC.Y.C. is the director of the UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery and receives research support for SARS-CoV-2 studies from Abbott Laboratories.

%X Background The highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is a global concern. This study assessed the neutralization activity of two-dose regimens of mRNA-1273 vaccination against Omicron in adults, adolescents and children.Methods Neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant was evaluated in serum samples from adults (≥18 years) in the phase 3, Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) and from adolescents (12-17 years) in the TeenCOVE trials following a two-dose regimen of 100 µg mRNA-1273 and from children (6-&lt;12 years) in the KidCOVE trial administered two doses of 50 µg mRNA-1273. Neutralizing antibody geometric mean ID50 titers (GMT) were measured using a lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralizing assay at day 1 and 4 weeks (day 57) following the second mRNA-1273 dose, compared with wild-type (D614G).Results At 4 weeks following a second dose of mRNA-1273 (100 µg), the GMT was reduced 28.8-fold compared with D614G in adults (≥18 years). In adolescents (12-17 years), the GMT was 11.8-fold lower than D614G, 4 weeks after a second dose of mRNA-1273 (100 µg), and compared with adults, were 1.5- and 3.8-fold higher for D614G and the Omicron variant, respectively.

%X The emergence of rapidly spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a major challenge to the ability of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies to provide immunity. These variants contain mutations at specific amino acids that might impede vaccine efficacy. BriLife® (rVSV-ΔG-spike) is a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate currently in Phase II clinical trials. It is based on a replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) platform. rVSV-ΔG-spike contains several spontaneously-acquired spike mutations that correspond to SARS-CoV-2 variants’ mutations. We show that human sera from BriLife® vaccinees preserve comparable neutralization titers towards alpha, gamma and delta variants, and show less than 3-fold reduction in neutralization capacity of beta and omicron compared to the original virus. Taken together, we show that human sera from BriLife® vaccinees overall maintain neutralizing antibody response against all tested variants. We suggest that BriLife® acquired mutations may prove advantageous against future SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04608305Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Serum samples of BriLife® vaccinees were obtained from participants in a randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase II of an ongoing clinical trial, aimed to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and potential efficacy of BriLife®, an rVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine (IIBR-100) in Adults (ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT04608305).

%X SARS-CoV-2 variants accumulating immune escape mutations provide a significant risk to vaccine-induced protection. The novel variant of concern (VoC) Omicron (B.1.1.529) has the largest number of amino acid alterations in its Spike protein to date. Thus, it may efficiently escape recognition by neutralizing antibodies, allowing breakthrough infections in convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We analyzed neutralization activity of sera from individuals after vaccination with all mRNA-, vector- or heterologous immunization schemes currently available in Europe by in vitro neutralization assay at peak response towards SARS-CoV-2 B.1, Omicron, Beta and Delta pseudotypes and also provide longitudinal follow-up data from BNT162b2 vaccinees. All vaccines apart from Ad26.CoV2.S showed high levels of responder rates (93-100%) towards SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, but some reductions in neutralizing Beta and Delta VoC pseudotypes. The novel Omicron variant had the biggest impact, both in terms of response rates and neutralization titers. Only mRNA-1273 showed a 100% response rate to Omicron and induced the highest level of neutralizing antibody titers, followed by heterologous prime-boost approaches. Homologous BNT162b2 vaccination or vector-based AZD1222 or Ad26.CoV2.S performed less well with peak responder rates of 33%, 50% and 9%, respectively. However, Omicron responder rates in BNT162b2 recipients were maintained in our six month longitudinal follow-up indicating that individuals with cross-protection against Omicron maintain it over time. Overall, our data strongly argues for urgent booster doses in individuals who were previously vaccinated with BNT162b2, or a vector-based immunization scheme.Competing Interest StatementNSM was a speaker at Luminex user meetings in the past.

%X We use a linear mixed model in order to estimate the effect of the number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 on the overall death toll on a monthly basis. We limit our analysis for the duration of the year 2021 and within 25 countries which are current or former (UK) members of the EU since these countries follow similar approaches to testing and reporting different COVID-19 related statistics. We explored the effect in question by comparing the total number of people vaccinated up to the end of each month and the total number of deaths occurring during the next month while controlling for several measures including number of new COVID-19 cases, diabetes prevalence, cardio vascular death rates and time trends among others. Our results indicated that one percentage point monthly increase in the total number of vaccinated people was associated, on average, with a decrease of two deaths per general population of 1 million for the next month with the effect being highly significant. An Individual Growth Curves Analysis further corroborates these findings and suggests that vaccination rates may possibly exert additional indirect effects unaccounted for by our main model.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In the current pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19), a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality and treat post-COVID-19 disease. Here, we analyzed alterations of sphingolipids and their metabolizing enzymes in 125 men and 74 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized with mild, moderate or severe symptoms or after convalescence.The activities of acid and neutral sphingomyelinases (ASM, NSM), which hydrolyze sphingomyelin to ceramide, were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients, while the activity of neutral ceramidase (NC), which hydrolyzes ceramide to sphingosine, was reduced. These alterations could each contribute to elevated ceramide levels in patients. Accordingly, liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) yielded increased levels of ceramides 16:0 and 18:0 with highest levels in severely affected patients and similar effects for dihydroceramides 16:0 and 18:0, whereas levels of (dihydro-)ceramides 24:0 were reduced. Furthermore, sphingomyelin 20:0; 22:0 and 24:0 as substrates of ASM and NSM as well as their dihydrosphingomyelin counterparts were reduced in patients as well as sphingosine-1-phosphate further downstream of NC activity. Effects of NSM, NC, ceramides and sphingomyelins remained significant after Bonferroni correction. SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in convalescent patients were associated with age but none of the sphingolipid parameters. Based on our data, COVID-19 is associated with a dysregulation of sphingolipid homeostasis in a severity-dependent manner, particularly focused around a reduction of sphingomyelins and an accumulation of ceramides by increased enzyme activities leading to ceramide elevation (ASM, NSM) combined with a decreased activity of enzymes (NC) reducing ceramide levels. The potential of a combined sphingolipid/enzyme pattern as a diagnostic and prognostic marker and therapeutic target deserves further exploration.Competing Interest StatementNH, AC, EG, JK and CM are listed as inventors on a patent application related to methods of treating COVID-19, filled by Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris.

%X Background Chile was severely affected by COVID19 outbreaks but was also one of the first countries to start a nationwide program to vaccinate against the disease. Furthermore, Chile became one of the fastest countries to inoculate a high percentage of the target population and implemented homologous and heterologous booster schemes in late 2021 to prevent potential immunological waning. The aim of this study is to compare the immunogenicity and time course of the humoral response elicited by the CoronaVac vaccine in combination with homologous versus heterologous boosters.Methods and Findings We compared the immunogenicity of two doses of CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccines and studied the effect of different booster regimes in the Chilean population. Our results demonstrate that a two-dose vaccination scheme with CoronaVac induces lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies than BNT162b2 in a broad age range. Furthermore, antibody production declines with time in individuals vaccinated with CoronaVac and less noticeably, with BNT162b2. Remarkably, analysis of booster schemes revealed that individuals vaccinated with two doses of CoronaVac generate immunological memory against the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain, which can be re-activated with homologous or heterologous (BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1) boosters. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the antibody response with the heterologous booster regime was considerably higher and persistent (over 100 days) than the responses induced by the homologous scheme.Conclusions Two doses of CoronaVac induces antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain which are lower in magnitude than those induced by the BNT162b2 vaccine. However, the response induced by CoronaVac can be greatly potentiated with a heterologous booster scheme with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines. Furthermore, the heterologous booster regimes induce a durable antibody response which does not show signs of decay 3 months after the booster dose.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a grant from the COVID-19 research program of the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), grant No 0752 (MRB, FO, ML).

%X Purpose We investigated SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced binding and live-virus neutralizing antibody response in NSCLC patients to the SARS-CoV-2 wild type strain and the emerging Delta and Omicron variants.Methods 82 NSCLC patients and 53 healthy adult volunteers who received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were included in the study. Blood was collected longitudinally, and SARS-CoV-2-specific binding and live-virus neutralization response to 614D (WT), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants were evaluated by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay and Focus Reduction Neutralization Assay (FRNT) respectively. We determined the longevity and persistence of vaccine-induced antibody response in NSCLC patients. The effect of vaccine-type, age, gender, race and cancer therapy on the antibody response was evaluated.Results Binding antibody titer to the mRNA vaccines were lower in the NSCLC patients compared to the healthy volunteers (P=&lt;0.0001). More importantly, NSCLC patients had reduced live-virus neutralizing activity compared to the healthy vaccinees (P=&lt;0.0001). Spike and RBD-specific binding IgG titers peaked after a week following the second vaccine dose and declined after six months (P=&lt;0.001). While patients &gt;70 years had lower IgG titers (P=&lt;0.01), patients receiving either PD-1 monotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of both did not have a significant impact on the antibody response. Binding antibody titers to the Delta and Beta variants were lower compared to the WT strain (P=&lt;0.0001). Importantly, we observed significantly lower FRNT50 titers to Delta (6-fold), and Omicron (79-fold) variants (P=&lt;0.0001) in NSCLC patients.Conclusions Binding and live-virus neutralizing antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in NSCLC patients were lower than the healthy vaccinees, with significantly lower live-virus neutralization of B.1.617.2 (Delta), and more importantly, the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant compared to the wild-type strain. These data highlight the concern for cancer patients given the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementM.S.S serves on the advisory board for Moderna and Ocugen.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported in part by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number P50CA217691.

%X Background Although high vaccine effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines was reported in studies in several countries, data is limited from Asian countries, especially against the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant.Methods We conducted a multicenter test-negative case-control study in patients aged ≥16 visiting hospitals or clinics with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from July 1 to September 30, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant (≥90% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infections) nationwide in Japan. Vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was evaluated. Waning immunity among patients aged 16 to 64 was also assessed.Results We enrolled 1936 patients, including 396 test-positive cases and 1540 test-negative controls for SARS-CoV-2. The median age was 49 years, 53.4% were male, and 34.0% had underlying medical conditions. Full vaccination (receiving two doses ≥14 days before symptom onset) was received by 6.6% of cases and 38.8% of controls. Vaccine effectiveness of full vaccination against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 88.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.8–93.9) among patients aged 16 to 64 and 90.3% (95% CI, 73.6–96.4) among patients aged ≥65. Among patients aged 16 to 64, vaccine effectiveness within one to three months after full vaccination was 91.8% (95% CI, 80.3–96.6), and was 86.4% (95% CI, 56.9–95.7) within four to six months.Conclusions mRNA COVID-19 vaccines had high effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Japan during July 1 to September 30, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant nationwide.Competing Interest StatementThe Department of Respiratory Infections, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University has received grants not directly related to this surveillance from Pfizer Inc.

%X Globally 58.83% human population received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccines as of 5 January 2021. COVID-19 vaccination rollout is progressing at varied rates globally and data on the impact of mass vaccination on infection and case-fatality rates require definition. We compared the global reported cumulative case-fatality rate (rCFR) between top-20 countries with COVID-19 vaccination rates (&gt;125 doses/100 people) and the rest of the world, before and after commencement of vaccination programmes.We considered the 28th day of receiving the first vaccine in the world as a cut-off to compare the pre-vaccine period (Jan 1, 2020 – Jan 5, 2021) and the post-vaccine period (Jan 6, 2021-Jan 5, 2022). We used a Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a beta distribution to investigate the association between the CFR and potential predictors of each country and reported the relative risk (RR) of each variable.The mean rCFR of COVID-19 in the top-20 countries with vaccination rates was 1.83 (95% CI: 1.24-2.43) on 5 Jan 2021 and 1.18 (95% CI: 0.73-1.62) on 5 Jan 2022. The CFR for the rest of the world on 5 Jan 2021 was 2.32 (95% CI: 1.86-2.79) and 2.20 (95% CI: 1.86-2.55) on 5 January 2022. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the CFR remained roughly unchanged at 1.97 (95% CI: 1.59-2.35) on 5 Jan 2021 and 1.98 (95% CI:1.58-2.37) on 5 Jan 2022. The GLMM showed vaccination (/100 population) (RR:0.37) and Stringency Index (RR:0.88) were strong protective factors for the country’s COVID-19 CFR indicating that both vaccination and lockdown measures help in the reduction of COVID-19 CFR.The rCFR of COVID-19 continues to decline, although at a disproportionate rate between top vaccinated countries and the rest of the world. Vaccine equity and faster roll-out across the world is critically important in reducing COVID-19 transmission and CFR.What is already knownVaccination can reduce the case-fatality rate of COVID-19. Globally, the COVID-19 vaccination rollout is progressing at varied rates.What are the new findingsIn the top-20 countries with vaccination, &gt;200 doses of vaccines are given per 100 people on 5th Jan 2022, In the rest of the word, the figure is 105, and in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) only 15.72After the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination the reported case-fatality rate (rCFR) of COVID-19 has reduced by 35% in the top-20 countries with vaccination, 8% in the rest of the world roughly unchanged in SSA.The doses of COVID-19 vaccines (/100 people) and rCFR has a negative correlation on 5 Jan 2022 (r=-0.296, p&lt;0.001).The COVID-19 vaccination and Stringency Index are strong protective factors for the country’s COVID-19 rCFR indicating that both vaccination and lockdown measures help in reduction of COVID-19 rCFR.What do the new findings implyThe disproportionate case-fatality rate of COVID-19 between top vaccinated countries and the rest of the world demand fast and equitable vaccine rollout globally to reduce COVID-19 transmission and CFRCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThere was no funding for this research.NH, FN, OD, RA AZ, RK are part of PANDORA-ID-NET Consortium (EDCTP Reg/Grant RIA2016E-1609) funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP2) programme, which is supported under Horizon 2020, the European Union's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Here we report our results of a multi-center, open cohort study (“COVID-Kids-Bavaria”) investigating the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 among children and staff in 99 daycare facilities and 48 elementary schools in Bavaria, Germany. Overall, 2568 children (1337 school children, 1231 preschool children) and 1288 adults (466 teachers, 822 daycare staff) consented to participate in the study and were randomly tested in three consecutive phases (September/October 2020, November/December 2020, March 2021). In total, 7062 throat swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. In phase I, only one daycare worker tested positive. In phase II, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in three daycare workers, two preschool children, and seven school children. In phase III, no sample tested positive. This corresponds to a positive test rate of 0.05% in phase I, 0.4% in phase II and 0% in phase III. After phase III, antibody testing was offered to 713 study participants in elementary schools. A seroprevalence rate of 7.7% (students) and 4.5% (teachers) was determined. We conclude that during the initial waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 result correlated positively with the local 7-day incidence. Thus, an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the setting of daycare and elementary schooling was unlikely.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Science and the Arts.

%X Background The rapid emergence of new vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) requires an equally rapid deployment of diagnostic tests to specifically identify each VOC as soon as it arises. Here, we report an expanded version of our previously described sloppy molecular beacon (SMB) Alpha/Beta/Gamma RT-PCR melting temperature (Tm) signature-based assay, which now includes modifications that allow specific detection of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.529) VOCs.Methods We developed a dual SMB assay (SMB-452), which targeted the T22917G (L452R) mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to specifically detect the Delta VOC. We also identified a Tm profile in our existing SMB-501 and SMB-484 assays (which detect mutations in codons 501 and 484 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, respectively) that differentiate the Omicron-specific N501Y (A23063T) and E484A (A23013C) mutations from both wild type (WT) and other VOCs. The entire six SMB three-codon assay was tested using reference SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. The assay was then validated using clinical samples from COVID-19 patients tested with a LightCycler 480 (LC480) (74 samples), Bio-Rad CFX96 (34 samples), Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) (34 samples) and an ABI-7500 (34 samples) RT-PCR instruments. Six SMB Tm results were then inputted into an Excel Analysis tool to generate specific VOC identifications.Results The limit of detection (LOD) for the new SMB-452 assay, which specifically identified the Delta variant was 1 genomic equivalent (GE) per reaction. The LODs of the SMB-501 and SMB-484 assays, which detect Omicron were 100 and 103 GE respectively. Clinical validation of the 3-codon assay in the LC480 instrument showed the assay detected 94% of the samples as WT or VOCs in clinical samples and 6% of the tests producing indeterminate results. None of the samples were incorrectly identified as WT or as a different VOC. Thus, excluding samples with indeterminant results, the assay was 100% sensitive and 100% specific compared to sequencing. There was also 100% concordance between the LC480, BioRad, ABI and Qiagen results, excluding negative or indeterminate results; however, the Qiagen assay had significantly more indeterminates than the other assays.Conclusion This new assay can serve as a robust diagnostic tool for selecting appropriate monoclonal antibody therapy and rapid VOC surveillance.Competing Interest StatementD.A. receives research support and royalty payments from Cepheid, which sells the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV tests., S.C, is an employee of Cepheid and R.J. is a paid consultant for Cepheid.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under award number R01 AI131617Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The usage of de-identified clinical samples from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 positive and negative patients in this study was approved by the Rutgers University institutional Review Board under protocol numbers 20170001218 and 2020001541.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Japan in November 2021. This variant contains up to 36 mutations in the spike protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and can escape vaccine-induced immunity. The third booster vaccination campaign began with healthcare workers and high-risk groups. The safety and immunogenicity of third booster vaccination against Omicrons remain unknown.Methods In total, 272 healthcare workers were evaluated for their long-term safety and immunogenicity. Here, we established vaccine panels to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity against variants of concern (VOCs), including the Omicron variant, using a live virus microneutralization assay.Findings Two-dose vaccination induced robust anti-spike antibodies and neutralization titers (NTs) against the ancestral strain WK-521, whereas NTs in VOCs were significantly decreased. Within 93–247 days of the second vaccine dose, NTs against Omicron were completely abolished in up to 80% of individuals among the vaccine panels. The third booster vaccination induced a robust increase in anti-spike antibodies and NTs against the WK-521, Delta, and Omicron variants. The breadth of humoral immunity and cross-reactivity with Omicron increased. The cytokine signature and adverse event rate remained unchanged after three-dose vaccination.Conclusions The third vaccination dose is safe and effective against Omicron infection.Funding This study was supported by grants from AMED (Grant Number JP21fk0108104 and JP21mk0102146).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by grants from AMED (Grant Number JP21fk0108104 and JP21mk0102146).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Medical research ethics committee of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and Murayama Medical center, National Hospital Organization.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Patients with COVID-19 may develop abnormal inflammatory response and lymphopenia, followed in some cases by delayed-onset syndromes, often long-lasting after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. As viral infections may activate human endogenous retroviral elements (HERV), we studied the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on HERV-W and HERV-K envelope (ENV) expression, known to be involved in immunological and neurological pathogenesis of human diseases. Our results have showed that the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus activates early HERV-W and K transcription but only HERV-W ENV protein expression, in an infection- and ACE2-independent way within peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures from one-third of healthy donors. Moreover, HERV-W ENV protein was significantly increased in serum and plasma of COVID-19 patients, correlating with its expression in CD3+ lymphocytes and with disease severity. Finally, HERV-W ENV was found expressed in post-mortem tissues of lungs, heart, brain olfactory bulb and nasal mucosa from acute COVID-19 patients in cell-types relevant for COVID-19-associated pathogenesis within affected organs, but different from those expressing of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Altogether, the present study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can induce HERV-W ENV expression in cells from individuals with symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Our data suggest that HERV-W ENV is likely to be involved in pathogenic features underlying symptoms of acute and post-acute COVID. It highlights the importance to further understand patients’ genetic susceptibility to HERV-W activation and the relevance of this pathogenic element as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in COVID-19 associated syndromes.Competing Interest StatementHP, BC, JB, JP, NQ received compensation for their work from Geneuro Innovation (France) Funding StatementThis study was funded by the french National Agency for Researsch (ANR) - program RA-COVID-19 V15 (project name : COVERI)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:- Ethics committee/IRB of SECRETARIA DE SALUD INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ENFERMEDADES RESPIRATORIAS ISMAEL COSIO VILLEGAS (MEXICO)gave ethical approval for this work - Ethics committee/IRB of HOSPICES CIVILS DE LYON (HCL)/ BIOBANK OF CROIX ROUSSE HOSPITAL (FRANCE) gave ethical approval for this work - Ethics committee/IRB of SERVICIOS CIENTIFICO TECNICOS - SERVICIO DE BIOBANCO (BSSA)OF UNIVERSITY OF SARAGOZA (SPAIN) gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X This era of emerging variants needs a thorough evaluation of data on the long-term efficacy of immune responses in vaccinated as well as recovered individuals, to understand the overall evolution of the pandemic. In this study, we aimed to assess the dynamics of IgG titers over 18 months in n=36 patients from the Umbria region in Italy, who had a documented history of COVID-19 infection in March 2020, and then compared the impact of two-dose BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccination on the antibody titers of these patients with the ones who did not receive any dose of vaccine. This is the longest observation (March 2020-September 2021) for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in recovered individuals along with the impact of 2 dose-BNT162b2 vaccination on the titers. Fixed-effect regression models were used for statistical analysis which could be also used to predict future titer trends. At 18 months, 97% participants tested positive for anti-NCP hinting towards the persistence of infection-induced immunity even for the vaccinated individuals. Our study findings demonstrate that while double dose vaccination boosted the IgG titers in recovered individuals 161 times, this “boost” was relatively short-lived. The unvaccinated recovered individuals, in contrast, continued to show a steady decline but detectable antibody levels. Further studies are required to re-evaluate the timing and dose regimen of vaccines for an adequate immune response in recovered individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethic committee/IRB of Associazione Naso Sano gave ethical approval for this work.

%X The new variant Omicron (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in November 2021, is rapidly spreading all around the world. The Omicron becomes the dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2. There are many ongoing studies evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines. Studies on neutralizing activity of vaccinated sera against Omicron variant are currently being carried out in many laboratories.In this study, we have shown the neutralizing activity of sera against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant compared to the reference Wuhan D614G (B.1) variant in individuals vaccinated with 2 doses of Sputnik V or BNT162b2 in different time points up to 6 months after vaccination. We performed analysis on sample pools with comparable NtAb to Wuhan D614G variant. The decrease in neutralizing antibody (NtAb) to the Omicron variant was 8.1 folds for group of Sputnik V-vaccinated and 21.4 folds for group of BNT162b2-vaccinated. Analysis showed that 74.2% of Sputnik V- and 56.9% of BNT162b2-vaccinated sera had detectable NtAb to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.The decrease in NtAb to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant compared to Wuhan variant has been shown for many COVID-19 vaccines in use, with some showing no neutralization at all. Today the necessity of third booster vaccination is obvious. And the most effective approach, already shown in several studies, is the use of heterologous booster vaccination pioneered in COVID-19 vaccines by Sputnik V.Competing Interest StatementGDM, DIV, SDV, TAI, ZOV, LDY, NBS and GAL report patents for a Sputnik V immunobiological expression vector, pharmaceutical agent, and its method of use to prevent COVID-19.

%X In 731 persons seeking COVID-19 testing at a walk-up San Francisco community site in January 2022, simultaneous nasal rapid antigen testing (BinaxNOW™) and RT-PCR testing was performed. There were 296 (40.5%) positive tests by RT-PCR; 98.5% of a random sample (N=67) were the omicron variant. Sensitivity of a single antigen test was 95.2% (95% CI 92-98%); 82.1% (95% CI 77-87%) and 65.2% (95% CI 60-71%) for Ct threshold of &lt; 30, &lt; 35 and no threshold, respectively. We also compared BinaxNOW™ to RT-PCR from oral cheek swabs to nasal swabs (N=75); oral cheek specimen was significantly less sensitive than nasal swab. A single BinaxNOW™ oral cheek rapid antigen test failed to detect 91% (20 of 22) of specimens that were BinaxNOW™ positive from the standard nasal sampling. In a separate direct comparison of BinaxNOW™ between specimens collected from nasal or throat (tonsillar) swab (N=115), sensitivity was 97.7% for nasal and 48.8% for throat swabs that were PCR-positive on nasal swab with a Ct threshold &lt; 30. Among persons with either a nasal or throat RT-PCR positive swab with Ct&lt;30, BinaxNOW™ sensitivity was 85.7% for nasal and 89.8% for nasal plus throat swabs. BinaxNOW continues to be a very useful diagnostic during the omicron surge; oral (throat or cheek swab) should not replace nasal swabs due to significantly reduced sensitivity compared to nasal. As currently recommended, repeat testing should be done for high-risk persons with an initial negative antigen test result.Competing Interest StatementDiane Havlir reports non-financial support for other projects from Gilead Sciences and AbbottFunding StatementFunding for this study was provided by UCSF, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the Patrick J.

%X Omicron, the novel highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC, Pango lineage B.1.1.529), was first collected in early November 2021 in South Africa. By the end of November 2021, it had spread and approached fixation in South Africa, and had been detected on all continents. We analyzed the exponential growth of Omicron over the four-week periods in two most populated South Africa’s provinces, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, arriving at the doubling time estimates of respectively 3.3 days [95% CI: 3.2–3.4 days] and 2.7 days [95% CI: 2.3–3.3 days]. Similar or even shorter doubling times were observed in other locations: Australia (3.0 days), New York State (2.5 days), UK (2.4 days), and Denmark (2.0 days). Log– linear regression suggests that the spread began in Gauteng around October 11, 2021, however, due to presumable stochasticity in the initial spread, this estimate can be inaccurate. Phylogenetics-based analysis indicates that the Omicron strain started to diverge in between October 6 and October 29, 2021. We estimated that the weekly growth of the ratio of Omicron to Delta is in the range 7.2–10.2, considerably higher than the growth of the ratio of Delta to Alpha (estimated to be in in the range 2.5–4.2), and Alpha to pre-existing strains (estimated to be in the range of 1.8–2.7). High relative growth does not necessarily imply higher Omicron infectivity. A two-strain SEIR model suggests that the growth advantage of Omicron may stem from immune evasion, which permits this VOC to infect both the recovered and the fully vaccinated individuals. As we demonstrated within the model, immune evasion is more concerning than increased transmissibility, because it can facilitate larger epidemic outbreaks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the National Science Centre Poland OPUS grant 2018/29/B/NZ2/00668 and Norwegian Financial Mechanism GRIEG-1 grant 2019/34/H/NZ6/00699 (operated by the National Science Centre Poland).

%X We report the interim safety and immunogenicity results in participants administrated with a booster dose of protein subunit vaccine MVC-COV1901 at 12 or 24 weeks after two doses of AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). In subjects fully vaccinated with two doses of AZD1222, waning antibody immunity was apparent within six months of the second dose of AZD1222. At one month after the MVC-COV1901 booster dose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers were 14- and 8.6-fold increased, respectively, when compared to the titer levels on the day of the booster dose. We also observed 5.2- and 5.6-fold increases in neutralizing titer levels against wildtype and Omicron variant pseudovirus after the booster dose, respectively. These interim results support the use of MVC-COV1901 as a heterologous booster for individuals vaccinated with AZD1222.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT05097053Funding StatementMedigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation and Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, TaiwanAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Medical Ethics and Institutional Review Board of Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background Viral load (VL) is one determinant of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Emergence of variants of concerns (VOC) Alpha and Delta was ascribed, at least partly, to higher VL. Furthermore, with parts of the population vaccinated, knowledge on VL in vaccine-breakthrough infections is crucial. As RNA VL is only a weak proxy for infectiousness, studies on infectious virus presence by cell culture isolation are of importance.Methods We assessed nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients for quantitative infectious viral titres (IVT) by focus-forming assay and compared to overall virus isolation success and RNA genome copies. We assessed IVTs during the first 5 symptomatic days in a total of 384 patients: unvaccinated individuals infected with pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2 (n= 118) or Delta (n= 127) and vaccine breakthrough infections with Delta (n= 121) or Omicron (n=18).Findings Correlation between RNA copy number and IVT was low for all groups. No correlation between IVTs and age or sex was seen. We observed higher RNA genome copies in pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2 compared to Delta, but significantly higher IVTs in Delta infected individuals. Vaccinated Delta infected individuals had significantly lower RNA genome copies and IVTs compared to unvaccinated subjects and cleared virus faster. In addition, vaccinated individuals with Omicron infection had comparable IVTs to Delta breakthrough infections.Interpretation Quantitative IVTs can give detailed insights into virus shedding kinetics. Vaccination was associated with lower infectious titres and faster clearance for Delta, showing that vaccination would also lower transmission risk. Omicron vaccine-breakthrough infections did not show elevated IVTs compared to Delta, suggesting that other mechanisms than increase VL contribute to the high infectiousness of Omicron.Funding This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation 196644, 196383, NRP (National Research Program) 78 Covid-19 Grant 198412, the Fondation Ancrage Bienfaisance du Groupe Pictet and the Fondation Privée des Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation 196644, 196383, NRP (National Research Program) 78 Covid-19 Grant 198412, the Fondation Ancrage Bienfaisance du Groupe Pictet and the Fondation Privee des Hopitaux Universitaires de Geneve.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Cantonal ethics committee of University Hospitals of Geneva (CCER Nr. 2021-01488).

%X Background Recent data on immune evasion of new SARS-CoV-2 variants raise concerns about antibody-based COVID-19 therapies. Therefore in this study the in-vitro neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 variants Wuhan D614G, Delta and Omicron in sera of convalescent individuals with and without boost by vaccination was assessed.Methods and Findings This in-vitro study included 66 individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, divided into subgroups without (n=29) and with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=37). We measured SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations by serological assays (anti-SARS-CoV-2-QuantiVac-ELISA (IgG) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S) and neutralizing titers against Wuhan D614G, Delta and Omicron in a pseudovirus neutralization assay.Sera of the majority of unvaccinated convalescents did not effectively neutralize Delta and Omicron (4/29, 13.8% and 19/29, 65.5%, resp.). Neutralizing titers against Wuhan D614G, Delta and Omicron were significantly higher in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated convalescents (p&lt;0.0001) with 11.1, 15.3 and 60-fold higher geometric mean of 50%-neutralizing titers (NT50) in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated convalescents. The increase in neutralizing titers was already achieved by one vaccination dose. Neutralizing titers were highest in the first 3 months after vaccination. Concentrations of anti-S antibodies in the serological assays anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac-ELISA (IgG) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S predict neutralization capacity against Wuhan D614G, Delta and Omicron. While Wuhan D614G was neutralized in-vitro by Bamlanivimab, Casirivimab and Imdevimab, Omicron was resistant to these monoclonal antibodies.Conclusions These findings confirm substantial immune evasion of Delta and Omicron which can be overcome by vaccination of convalescents. This informs strategies for choosing of plasma donors in COVID-19 convalescent plasma programs that shall select specifically vaccinated convalescents with very high titers of anti-S antibodies.Competing Interest StatementI have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: B.J., S.K., R.L., R.M., P.W., M.S., H.K. and H.S. are employees of a blood transfusion service collecting plasma including convalescent plasma.Funding StatementThe clinical trials COVIC-19 (EudraCT 021-006621-22) is supported by the Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research)(www.bmbf.de) and the randomized clinical trial CAPSID (EudraCT including the preparation of convalescent plasma units was supported by the Bundesministerium fuer Gesundheit (German Federal Ministry of Health)(www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de).

%X The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic continues to have major impacts on children’s education, with schools required to implement infection control measures that have led to long periods of absence and classroom closures. We have developed an agent-based epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that allows us to quantify projected infection patterns within primary school classrooms, and related uncertainties; the basis of our approach is a contact model constructed using random networks, informed by structured expert judgement. The effectiveness of mitigation strategies are considered in terms of effectiveness at supressing infection outbreaks and limiting pupil absence. Covid-19 infections in schools in the UK in Autumn 2020 are re-examined and the model used for forecasting infection levels in autumn 2021, as the more infectious Delta-variant was emerging and school transmission thought likely to play a major role in an incipient new wave of the epidemic. Our results were in good agreement with available data. These findings indicate that testing-based surveillance of infections in the classroom population with isolation of positive cases is a more effective mitigation measure than bubble quarantine, both for reducing transmission in primary schools and for avoiding pupil absence, even accounting for insensitivity of self-administered tests. Bubble quarantine entails large numbers of pupils being absent from school, with only modest impact on classroom infection levels. However, maintaining reduced contact rates within the classroom can have a major beneficial impact for managing Covid-19 in school settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementMJW and WPA acknowledge funding from the "COVID-19 Mapping and Mitigation in Schools" (CoMMinS) project which is supported by the Medical Research Council (grant no.

%X The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has triggered a devastating global health, social and economic crisis. The RNA nature and broad circulation of this virus facilitate the accumulation of mutations, leading to the continuous emergence of variants of concern with increased transmissibility or pathogenicity1. This poses a major challenge to the effectiveness of current vaccines and therapeutic antibodies1, 2. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic and preventive measures with a broad spectrum of action, especially against variants with an unparalleled number of mutations such as the recently emerged Omicron variant, which is rapidly spreading across the globe3. Here, we used combinatorial antibody phage-display libraries from convalescent COVID-19 patients to generate monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ultrapotent neutralizing activity. One such antibody, NE12, neutralizes an early isolate, the WA-1 strain, as well as the Alpha and Delta variants with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations at picomolar level. A second antibody, NA8, has an unusual breadth of neutralization, with picomolar activity against both the Beta and Omicron variants. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of NE12 and NA8 was confirmed in preclinical studies in the golden Syrian hamster model. Analysis by cryo-EM illustrated the structural basis for the neutralization properties of NE12 and NA8.

%X The new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) Omicron has more than 30 mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein enabling viral escape from antibodies in vaccinated individuals and increased transmissibility1-6. It is unclear how vaccine immunity protects against Omicron infection. Here we show that vaccinated participants at a superspreader event had robust recall response of humoral and pre-existing cellular immunity induced by the vaccines, and an emergent de novo T cell response to non-Spike antigens. We compared cases from a Christmas party where 81 of 110 (74%) developed Omicron breakthrough COVID-197, with Delta breakthrough cases and vaccinated non-infected controls. Omicron cases had significantly increased activated SARS-CoV-2 wild type Spike-specific (vaccine) cytotoxic T cells, activated follicular helper (TFH) cells, functional T cell responses, boosted humoral responses, activated anti-Spike plasmablasts and anti-RBD memory B cells compared to controls. Omicron cases had significantly increased de novo memory T cell responses to non-Spike viral antigens compared to Delta breakthrough cases demonstrating development of broad immunity. The rapid release of Spike and RBD-specific IgG+ B cell plasmablasts and memory B cells into circulation suggested affinity maturation of antibodies and that concerted T and B cell immunity may provide durable broad immunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, the Norwegian Ministry of Health through a programme for corona vaccination surveillance, the Research Council of Norway (RCN) Covid (312693); a KG Jebsen Foundation (grant 19); the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI); and the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approvals have been obtained from the Regional Ethics Authority, South Eastern NorwayI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The COVID-19 pandemic situation has been changing drastically worldwide due to the continuous appearance of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the roll-out of mass vaccination. Periodic cross-sectional studies during the surge of COVID-19 cases is essential to elucidate the pandemic situation.Methods Sera of 1,000 individuals who underwent a health check-up in Hyogo Prefecture Health Promotion Association clinics in Japan were collected in August and December 2021. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 N and S antigens were detected in the sera by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The sera’s neutralization activities for the conventional SARS-CoV-2 (D614G), Delta, and Omicron variants were measured.Results The seropositive rates for the antibody against N antigen were 2.1% and 3.9% in August and December 2021 respectively, demonstrating a Delta variant endemic during that time; the actual infection rate was approximately twofold higher than the rate estimated based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis. The anti-S seropositive rate was 38.7% in August and it reached 90.8% in December, in concordance with the vaccination rate in Japan. In the December cohort, 78.7% of the sera showed neutralizing activity against the Delta variant, whereas that against the Omicron was much lower at 36.6%.Conclusions These analyses revealed that herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 including the Delta variant was established in December 2021, leading to convergence of the variants. The low neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant suggests the need for the further promotion of the prompt three-dose vaccination to overcome this variant’s imminent 6th wave in Japan.Summary Seroepidemiologic study of COVID-19 on December 2021 in Japan showed neutralizing antibodies for Delta were 78.7%, indicating the acquisition of herd immunity by mass vaccination leading to convergence while those for Omicron were only 36.6%, indicating need of booster vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Hyogo Prefectural Government.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The seroepidemiologic surveillance was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine (approval code: B2156702).

%X Immune memory is tailored by cues that lymphocytes perceive during priming. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic created a situation in which nascent memory could be tracked through additional antigen exposures. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination induce multifaceted, functional immune memory, but together they engender improved protection from disease, termed “hybrid immunity”. We therefore investigated how vaccine-induced memory is shaped by previous infection. We found that following vaccination, previously infected individuals generated more SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific memory B cells and variant-neutralizing antibodies and a distinct population of IFN-γ and IL-10-expressing memory SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells than previously naive individuals. While additional vaccination could increase humoral memory, it did not recapitulate the distinct CD4+ T cell cytokine profile in previously naive individuals. Thus, imprinted features of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes define hybrid immunity.Competing Interest StatementM.P. is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of VaxArt and NeoLeukin Inc.

%T Neutralization of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Zeta and Omicron by mRNA vaccination and infection-derived immunity through homologous and heterologous variants

%X Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/interest (VOC/VOI) raise questions about effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies derived from infection or vaccination. As the population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has become more complex due to prior infection and/or vaccination, understanding the antigenic relationship between variants is needed.Here, we have assessed in total 104 blood specimens from convalescent individuals after infection with early-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (pre-VOC) or with Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta, post-vaccination after double-dose mRNA-vaccination and break through infections due to Delta or Omicron. Neutralization against seven authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates (B.1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Zeta, Omicron) was assessed by plaque-reduction neutralization assay.We found highest neutralization titers against the homologous (previously infecting) variant, with lower neutralization efficiency against heterologous variants. Significant loss of neutralization for Omicron was observed but to a varying degree depending on previously infecting variant (23.0-fold in Beta-convalescence up to 56.1-fold in Alpha-convalescence), suggesting that infection-derived immunity varies, but independent of the infecting variant is only poorly protective against Omicron. Of note, Zeta VOI showed also pronounced escape from neutralization of up to 28.2-fold in Alpha convalescent samples. Antigenic mapping reveals both Zeta and Omicron as separate antigenic clusters.Double dose vaccination showed robust neutralization for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Zeta, with fold-change reduction of only 2.8 (for Alpha) up to 6.9 (for Beta). Escape from neutralization for Zeta was largely restored in vaccinated individuals, while Omicron still showed a loss of neutralization of 85.7-fold compared to pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2.Combined immunity from infection followed by vaccination or vaccine breakthrough infection showed highest titers and most robust neutralization for heterologous variants. Breakthrough infection with Delta showed only 12.5-fold reduced neutralization for Omicron, while breakthrough infection with Omicron showed only a 1.5-fold loss for Delta, suggests that infection with antigenically different variants can boost immunity for antigens closer to the vaccine strain. Antigenic cartography showed also a tendency towards broader neutralizing capacity for heterologous variants.We conclude that the complexity of background immunity needs to be taken into account when assessing new VOCs. Development towards separate serotypes such as Zeta was already observed before Omicron emergence, thus other factors than just immune escape must contribute to Omicrons rapid dominance. However, combined infection/vaccination immunity could ultimately lead to broad neutralizing capacity also against non-homologous variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation 196644, 196383, NRP (National Research Program) 78 Covid-19 Grant 198412, the Fondation Ancrage Bienfaisance du Groupe Pictet and the private foundation of the University Hospitals of Geneva.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of the University Hospitals of Geneva gave ethical approval for the work under the following protocols/numbers: - Understanding COVID study; ethics approval number: CCER 2020-00516, - Persistence study: ethics approval number: CCER 2020-00516 - Collection of sera from variantsEthics approval number: CCER 2020-02323 In addition, anonymized left-over specimens were used under general informed consent of the University Hospitals of Geneva, also approved by the Ethics committee of the University Hospitals of Geneva - CCER ICOVax 2021-00430I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has motivated a re-evaluation of the test characteristics for lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIAs), commonly referred to as rapid antigen tests. To address this need, we evaluated the analytic sensitivity of one of the most widely used LFIAs in the US market, the Abbott BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Ag At-Home Card using 32 samples of Omicron and 30 samples of the Delta variant. Samples were chosen to intentionally over-represent the range of viral loads where differences are most likely to appear. We found no changes in the analytic sensitivity of the BinaxNOW™ assay by variant even after controlling for variation in cycle threshold values in the two populations. Similar to prior studies, the sensitivity of the assay is highly dependent on the amount of virus present in the sample. While the analytic sensitivity of the BinaxNOW™ LFIA remains intact versus the Omicron variant, its clinical sensitivity is influenced by the interaction between viral replication, the dynamics of tissue tropism and the timing of sampling. Further research is necessary to optimally adapt current testing strategies to robustly detect early infection by the Omicron variant to prevent transmission.Competing Interest StatementSK is the editor for the diagnostics section of the Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 Real-time Learning Network.

%X We previously reported a household secondary attack rate (SAR) for SARS-CoV-2 of 18.9% through June 17, 2021. To examine how emerging variants and increased vaccination have affected transmission rates, we searched PubMed from June 18, 2021, through January 7, 2022. Meta-analyses used generalized linear mixed models to obtain SAR estimates and 95%CI, disaggregated by several covariates. SARs were used to estimate vaccine effectiveness based on the transmission probability for susceptibility (VES,p), infectiousness (VEI,p), and total vaccine effectiveness (VET,p). Household SAR for 27 studies with midpoints in 2021 was 35.8% (95%CI, 30.6%-41.3%), compared to 15.7% (95%CI, 13.3%-18.4%) for 62 studies with midpoints through April 2020. Household SARs were 38.0% (95%CI, 36.0%-40.0%), 30.8% (95%CI, 23.5%-39.3%), and 22.5% (95%CI, 18.6%-26.8%) for Alpha, Delta, and Beta, respectively. VEI,p, VES,p, and VET,p were 56.6% (95%CI, 28.7%-73.6%), 70.3% (95%CI, 59.3%-78.4%), and 86.8% (95%CI, 76.7%-92.5%) for full vaccination, and 27.5% (95%CI, -6.4%-50.7%), 43.9% (95%CI, 21.8%-59.7%), and 59.9% (95%CI, 34.4%-75.5%) for partial vaccination, respectively. Household contacts exposed to Alpha or Delta are at increased risk of infection compared to the original wild-type strain. Vaccination reduced susceptibility to infection and transmission to others.Summary Household secondary attack rates (SARs) were higher for Alpha and Delta variants than previous estimates. SARs were higher to unvaccinated contacts than to partially or fully vaccinated contacts and were higher from unvaccinated index cases than from fully vaccinated index cases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health R01-AI139761.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Objective To determine the impact of MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the development of cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.Methods MS patients aged 18-60 were evaluated for anti-nucleocapsid and anti-Spike RBD antibody with electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay; antibody responses to Spike protein, RBD, N-terminal domain with multiepitope bead-based immunoassays (MBI); live virus immunofluorescence-based microneutralization assay; T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike using TruCulture ELISA; and IL-2 and IFNγ ELISpot assays. Assay results were compared by DMT class. Spearman correlation and multivariate analyses were performed to examine associations between immunologic responses and infection severity.Results Between 1/6/2021 and 7/21/2021, 389 MS patients were recruited (mean age 40.3 years; 74% female; 62% non-White). Most common DMTs were ocrelizumab (OCR) - 40%; natalizumab - 17%, Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators −12%; and 15% untreated. 177 patients (46%) had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 130 had symptomatic infection, 47 - asymptomatic. Antibody responses were markedly attenuated in OCR compared to other groups (p≤ 0001). T-cell responses (IFNγ were decreased in S1P (p=0.03), increased in natalizumab (p&lt;0.001), and similar in other DMTs, including OCR. Cellular and humoral responses were moderately correlated in both OCR (r=0.45, p=0.0002) and non-OCR (r=0.64, p&lt;0.0001). Immune responses did not differ by race/ethnicity. COVID-19 clinical course was mostly non-severe and similar across DMTs; 7% (9/130) were hospitalized.Interpretation DMTs had differential effects on humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune responses did not correlate with COVID-19 clinical severity in this relatively young and non-disabled group of MS patients.Competing Interest StatementIK served on the scientific advisory board for Biogen Idec, Genentech, Alexion, EMDSerono; received consulting fees from Roche; and received research support from Guthy-Jackson Charitable Foundation, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Biogen Idec, Serono, Genzyme, and Genentech/Roche; he receives royalties from Wolters Kluwer for 'Top 100 Diagnosis in Neurology' (co-written with Jose Biller) GJS received honoraria from BMS, Eli Lilly and Genentech, and research support from BMS, Genentech, Lupus Research Alliance, NIH-NIAMS, NIH-NIAID and NIH-NILB.

%X Background Early estimates from South Africa indicated that the Omicron COVID-19 variant may be both more transmissible and have greater immune escape than the previously dominant Delta variant. The rapid turnover of the latest epidemic wave in South Africa as well as initial evidence from contact tracing and household infection studies has prompted speculation that the generation time of the Omicron variant may be shorter in comparable settings than the generation time of the Delta variant.Methods We estimated daily growth rates for the Omicron and Delta variants in each UKHSA region from the 23rd of November to the 23rd of December 2021 using surveillance case counts by date of specimen and S-gene target failure status with an autoregressive model that allowed for time-varying differences in the transmission advantage of the Delta variant where the evidence supported this. By assuming a gamma distributed generation distribution we then estimated the generation time distribution and transmission advantage of the Omicron variant that would be required to explain this time varying advantage. We repeated this estimation process using two different prior estimates for the generation time of the Delta variant first based on household transmission and then based on its intrinsic generation time.Results Visualising our growth rate estimates provided initial evidence for a difference in generation time distributions. Assuming a generation time distribution for Delta with a mean of 2.5-4 days (90% credible interval) and a standard deviation of 1.9-3 days we estimated a shorter generation time distribution for Omicron with a mean of 1.5-3.2 days and a standard deviation of 1.3-4.6 days. This implied a transmission advantage for Omicron in this setting of 160%-210% compared to Delta. We found similar relative results using an estimate of the intrinsic generation time for Delta though all estimates increased in magnitude due to the longer assumed generation time.Conclusions We found that a reduction in the generation time of Omicron compared to Delta was able to explain the observed variation over time in the transmission advantage of the Omicron variant. However, this analysis cannot rule out the role of other factors such as differences in the populations the variants were mixing in, differences in immune escape between variants or bias due to using the test to test distribution as a proxy for the generation time distribution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementS.

%X The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a threat to the general population. The ongoing vaccination programs provide protection to individuals and facilitate the opening of society and a return to normality. However, emergent and existing SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of evading the immune system endanger the efficacy of the vaccination strategy. To preserve the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination globally, aggressive and effective surveillance for known and emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOC) is required. Rapid and specific molecular diagnostics can provide speed and coverage advantages compared to genomic sequencing alone, benefitting the public health response and facilitating VOC containment. In this work, we expand the recently developed SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR-Cas detection technology (SHERLOCK) to allow rapid and sensitive discrimination of VOCs, that can be used at point of care and/or implemented in the pipelines of small or large testing facilities, and even determine proportion of VOCs in pooled population-level wastewater samples. This technology aims to complement the ongoing sequencing efforts to allow facile and, crucially, rapid identification of individuals infected with VOCs to help break infection chains. Here, we show the optimisation of our VarLOCK assays (Variant-specific SHERLOCK) for multiple specific mutations in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 and validation with samples from the Cardiff University Testing Service. We also show the applicability of VarLOCK to national wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, we show the rapid adaptability of the technique for new and emerging VOCs such as Omicron.Short abstract The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a threat as emergent and existing SARS-CoV-2 variants endanger the efficacy of the vaccination strategy.

%X Background Neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been reported to decline within 6 months of vaccination, particularly against Variants of Concern (VOC). We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of BBV152 administered 6 months after the second of a two-dose primary vaccination series.Methods In an ongoing phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04471519) the protocol was amended after six months to re-consent and randomise 184 previously vaccinated participants to receive a third dose of vaccine or placebo on Day 215. The primary outcome was to measure neutralising antibody titres by plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) four weeks after the booster; safety as serious adverse events (SAE) was the key secondary outcome.Findings Four weeks after a second BBV152 vaccination geometric mean titres (GMTs) of neutralising antibodies were 197·0 PRNT50 (95% CI: 155·6–249·4); this level declined to 23·9 PRNT50 (14·0–40·6) six months later, with a seroconversion rate of 75·4% (95% CI: 68·4–81·6). Four weeks after booster vaccination the GMT increased on Day 243 to 746·6 PRNT50 (514·9–1081) compared with 100·7 PRNT50 (43·6–232·6) in the placebo group. Corresponding seroconversion rates were 98·7% (92·8–99·9) and 79·8% (69·6–87·8). Increased titres in the placebo group were attributed to natural infection as the study was conducted during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. PRNT50 titres against the SARS-CoV-2 variants increased—Alpha (32·6-fold), Beta (161·0-fold), Delta (264·7-fold), and Delta plus (174·2-fold)—after the booster vaccination. We found that vaccine induces both memory B and T cells with a distinct AIM+ specific CD4+T central and effector memory phenotype, including CD8+ TEMRA phenotype. Reactogenicity after vaccine and placebo was minimal and comparable, and no SAEs were reported.Interpretation Six months after a two-dose BBV152 vaccination series cell mediated immunity and neutralising antibodies to both homologous (D614G) and heterologous strains (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Delta plus) persisted above baseline, although the magnitude of the responses had declined. Neutralising antibodies against homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants increased 19- to 97-fold after a third vaccination. Booster BBV152 vaccination is safe and may be necessary to ensure persistent immunity to prevent breakthrough infections.Funding This work was supported and funded by Bharat Biotech International Limited.Competing Interest StatementThis work was funded by Bharat Biotech International Limited.

%X Background There has been an unprecedented global effort to produce safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, production challenges, supply shortages and unequal global reach, together with an increased number of breakthrough infections due to waning of immunity and the emergence of new variants of concern (VOC), have prolonged the pandemic. To boost the immune response, several heterologous vaccination regimes have been tested and have shown increased antibody responses compared to homologous vaccination. Here we evaluated the effect of mRNA vaccine booster on immunogenicity in individuals who had been vaccinated with two doses of inactivated vaccines.Methods The levels of specific antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein from wild-type virus and the Beta, Delta and Omicron variants were measured in healthy individuals who had received two doses of homologous inactivated (BBIBP-CorV or CoronoVac) or mRNA (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) vaccines, and in donors who were given an mRNA vaccine boost after two doses of either vaccine. Pre-vaccinated healthy donors, or individuals who had been infected and subsequently received the mRNA vaccine were also included as controls. In addition, specific memory B and T cell responses were measured in a subset of samples.Results A booster dose of an mRNA vaccine significantly increased the level of specific antibodies that bind to the RBD domain of the wild-type (6-fold) and VOCs including Delta (8-fold) and Omicron (14-fold), in individuals who had previously received two doses of inactivated vaccines. The level of specific antibodies in the heterologous vaccination group was furthermore similar to that in individuals receiving a third dose of homologous mRNA vaccines or boosted with mRNA vaccine after natural infection. Moreover, this heterologous vaccination regime significantly enhanced the specific memory B and T cell responses.Conclusions Heterologous prime-boost immunization with inactivated vaccine followed by an mRNA vaccine boost markedly increased the levels of specific antibodies and B and T cell responses and may thus increase protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by The European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (ATAC, 101003650), the Center for Innovative Medicine at the Karolinska Institutet, the Swedish Research Council and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the ethics committees in institutional review board (IRB) of Stockholm, Technische Universitat Braunschweig and the Tehran University of Medical Sciences.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and disparities of vaccination coverage in low- and middle-income countries, it is vital to adopt a widespread testing and screening programme, combined with contact tracing, to monitor and effectively control the infection dispersion in areas where medical resources are limited. This work presents a lab-on-a-chip platform, namely “IFAST-CRISPR”, as an affordable, rapid and high-precision molecular diagnostic means for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The herein proposed “sample-to-answer” platform integrates RNA extraction, amplification and CRISPR-Cas-based detection with lateral flow readout in one device. The microscale dimensions of the device containing immiscible liquids, coupled with the use of silica paramagnetic beads and GuHCl, streamline sample preparation, including RNA concentration, extraction and purification, in 15 min with minimal hands-on steps. By combining RT-LAMP with CRISPR-Cas12 assays targeting the nucleoprotein (N) gene, visual identification of ≥ 470 copies mL-1 genomic SARS-CoV-2 samples was achieved in 45 min, with no cross-reactivity towards HCoV-OC43 nor H1N1. On-chip assays showed the ability to isolate and detect SARS-CoV-2 from 1,000 genome copies mL-1 of replication-deficient viral particles in 1 h. This simple, affordable and integrated platform demonstrated a visual, faster, and yet specificity and sensitivity-comparable alternative to the costly gold-standard RT-PCR assay, requiring only a simple heating source. Further investigations on multiplexing and direct interfacing of the accessible Swan-brand cigarette filter for saliva sample collection could provide a complete work flow for COVID-19 diagnostics from saliva samples suitable for low-resource settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Newton-Utafiti Fund Kenya Country Prize 2020.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Ethical Review Committee of Mount Kenya University (MKU/IERC/1811).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Highly transmissible or immuno-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants have intermittently emerged and outcompeted previously circulating strains, resulting in repeated COVID-19 surges, reinfections, and breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. With over 5 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced globally over the last 2 years, there is unprecedented data to decipher how competitive viral evolution results in the emergence of fitter SARS-CoV-2 variants. Much attention has been directed to studying how specific mutations in the Spike protein impact its binding to the ACE2 receptor or viral neutralization by antibodies, but there is limited knowledge of a genomic signature that is shared primarily by the sequential dominant variants. Here we introduce a methodology to quantify the genome-wide distinctiveness of polynucleotide fragments of various lengths (3-to 240-mers) that constitute SARS-CoV-2 sequences (freely available at https://academia.nferx.com/GENI). Compared to standard phylogenetic distance metrics and overall mutational load, the quantification of distinctive 9-mer polynucleotides provides a higher resolution of separation between VOCs (Reference = 89, IQR: 65-108; Alpha = 166, IQR: 150-182; Beta 130, IQR: 113-147; Gamma = 165, IQR: 152-180; Delta = 234, IQR: 216-253; and Omicron = 294, IQR: 287-315). Omicron’s exceptionally high genomic distinctiveness may confer a competitive advantage over both prior VOCs (including Delta) and the recently emerged and highly mutated B.1.640.2 (IHU) lineage. Expanding on this analysis, evaluation of genomic distinctiveness weighted by intra-lineage 9-mer conservation for 1,363 lineages annotated in GISAID highlights that genomic distinctiveness has increased over time (R2=0.37) and that VOCs score significantly higher than contemporary non-VOC lineages, with Omicron among the most distinctive lineages observed till date. This study demonstrates the value of characterizing new SARS-CoV-2 variants by their genome-wide polynucleotide distinctiveness and emphasizes the need to go beyond a narrow set of mutations at known functionally or antigenically salient sites on the Spike protein. The consistently higher distinctiveness of each emerging VOC compared to prior VOCs suggests that real-time monitoring of genomic distinctiveness would aid in more rapid assessment of viral fitness.Competing Interest StatementKM, MJMN, BR, PJL, PG, PA, TF, SS, RS, TJH and VS are employees of nference and have financial interests in the company. nference collaborates with health systems, bio-pharmaceutical companies, and academic medical centers on data science initiatives unrelated to this study.

%X Background Rapid expansion of the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern despite extensive vaccine coverage might be related to decreased neutralising ability of vaccine induced antibodies. The neutralising ability of different vaccines with or without natural SARS-CoV-2 infection against omicron is however not well known.Methods We tested the ability of vaccine and natural infection induced antibodies to neutralise omicron variant in a live virus neutralisation assay. Four groups of individuals were included: (i) complete vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=20), (ii) complete vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection during the delta variant driven surge (n=20), (iii) complete vaccination with inactivated whole virus vaccine (BBV152) (n=20), (iv) complete vaccination with BBV152 plus prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=20). Primary outcome was fold-change in the virus neutralisation ability of plasma against the omicron variant compared with ancestral and delta variant.Findings The neutralisation geometric mean titre (GMT) was 384 (95% CI: 662, 223) against the ancestral virus with BBV152 vaccination alone and 383 (95% CI: 709, 207) with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination alone. The corresponding values for hybrid immunity groups were 795 (95% CI: 1302, 486) and 1424 (95% CI: 2581,786) respectively. Against the omicron variant, only 5 out of 20 in both BBV152 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine only groups, 5 out of 19 in BBV152 plus SARS-CoV-2 infection group, and 9 out of 20 in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus SARS-CoV-2 infection group exhibited neutralisation titres above the lower limit of quantification (1:20) suggesting better neutralization in those with prior infection. The 50% neutralisation against ancestral strain and omicron demonstrated strong correlation with anti-RBD IgG levels [Pearson r: 0.94 (0.91, 0.96) p: &lt;0.001 and 0.92 (0.88, 0.95) p:&lt;0.001 respectively].Interpretation Omicron variant shows significant reduction in neutralising ability of both vaccine induced and hybrid immunity induced antibodies which might explain immune escape and high transmission even in the presence of widespread vaccine coverage.Funding DBT, India; GIISER-BMGF, USAEvidence before this study The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is fast becoming the dominant circulating strain world-wide. We did a literature search on PubMed between 01 November 2020 to 04 January 2022 using the terms “Omicron” and “neutralisation” and found 11 results for virus neutralisation against omicron by vaccine/natural infection induced antibodies. We identified two published and one preprint articles relevant to omicron virus neutralisation using live virus neutralization. Preliminary reports suggest that omicron variant is significantly less susceptible to in-vitro neutralisation by antibodies among recipients of mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273), adenovirus vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines) and no virus neutralization was observed in subjects who received Coronavac (inactivated virus vaccine). Data regarding immune escape among those with natural SARS-CoV2 infection and vaccination are not available.Added value of this study We report here that the proportion of neutralisers (those who demonstrated a FRNT50 titre &gt;1:20) was significantly reduced against the omicron variant as compared to the ancestral and delta variant. The geometric mean titre of neutralisation among the vaccinated individuals without a history of previous natural infection was significantly reduced against the omicron variant as compared with ancestral and delta variants. The titres among the those with a history of previous infection also followed the same pattern, but the neutralising ability was better in them than those who did not have previous infection.Implications of all the available evidence Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is capable of escaping immunity provided by currently available vaccines and even natural infection due to significant mutations in its spike protein. The drop in neutralisation might be alarming, but the real-world impact of these reduced neutralisation titres on major public health indices like hospitalisation rates and mortality rates have to be interpreted along with the other factors such as inherent pathogenicity of the variant, immunization uptakes and seroprevalence from natural infection in different geographical regions and the expected role of cellular immune responses to the variant. Our data may guide policy on booster vaccination to deal with an impending public health emergency as a result of surge in omicron cases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementInd-CEPI grant (102/IFD/SAN/5477/2018-2019) to Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad.

%X A new SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) Variant of Concern has been emerging worldwide. We are seeing an unprecedented surge in patients due to Omicron in this COVID-19 pandemic. A rapid and accurate molecular test that effectively differentiates Omicron from other SARS-CoV-2 variants would be important for both epidemiologic value and for directing variant-specific therapies such as monoclonal antibody infusions. In this study, we developed a real-time RT-PCR assay for the qualitative detection of Omicron from routine clinical specimens sampling the upper respiratory tract. The limit of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant RT-PCR assay was 2 copies/μl. Notably, the assay did not show any cross-reactivity with other SARS-CoV-2 variants including Delta (B.1.617.2). This SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant RT-PCR laboratory-developed assay is sensitive and specific to detect Omicron in nasopharyngeal and nasal swab specimens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was internally funded by the UPMC Clinical Laboratories as part of a Quality Improvement initiative.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The entire study was deemed to be a Quality Improvement initiative by the UPMC IRB and approved by the UPMC QI Review Board.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) contains mutations that mediate escape from infection and vaccine-induced antibody responses, although the extent to which these substitutions in spike and non-spike proteins affect T cell recognition is unknown. Here we show that T cell responses in individuals with prior infection, vaccination, both prior infection and vaccination, and boosted vaccination are largely preserved to Omicron spike and non-spike proteins. However, we also identify a subset of individuals (∼21%) with a &gt;50% reduction in T cell reactivity to the Omicron spike. Evaluation of functional CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell responses confirmed these findings and reveal that reduced recognition to Omicron spike is primarily observed within the CD8+ T cell compartment. Booster vaccination substantially enhanced T cell responses to Omicron spike. In contrast to neutralizing immunity, these findings suggest preservation of T cell responses to the Omicron variant, although with reduced reactivity in some individuals.Competing Interest StatementG.D.G has filed patent application PCT/US2021/028245.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Peter and Ann Lambertus Family Foundation.

%X The first cluster of SARS-CoV-2 cases with lineage B.1.1.7 in the state of Michigan was identified through intensive university-led surveillance sampling and targeted sequencing. A collaborative investigation and response was conducted by the local and state health departments, and the campus and athletic medicine COVID-19 response teams, using S-gene target failure screening and rapid genomic sequencing to inform containment strategies. A total of 50 cases of B.1.1.7-lineage SARS-CoV-2 were identified in this outbreak, which was due to three coincident introductions of B.1.1.7-lineage SARS-CoV-2, all of which were genetically distinct from lineages which later circulated in the broader community. This investigation demonstrates the successful implementation of a genomically-informed outbreak response which can be extended to university campuses and other settings at high risk for rapid emergence of new variants.Competing Interest StatementAll authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: Financial support for the submitted work from CDC and from university COVID response funds.

%X Background Limited commercial LFA assays are available to provide a reliable quantitative measurement of the total binding antibody units (BAU/mL) against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD).Aim To evaluate the performance of FinecareTM2019-nCoV S-RBD LFA and its fluorescent reader (FinecareTM-FIA Meter) against the following reference methods (i) The FDA-approved Genscript surrogate virus-neutralizing assay (sVNT), and (ii) three highly performing automated immunoassays: BioMérieux VIDAS®3, Ortho VITROS®, and Mindray CL-900i®.Methods Plasma from 488 vaccinees were tested by all aforementioned assays. Fingerstick whole-blood samples from 156 vaccinees were also tested by FinecareTM.Results and conclusions FinecareTM showed 100% specificity as none of the pre-pandemic samples tested positive. Equivalent FinecareTM results were observed among the samples taken from fingerstick or plasma (Pearson correlation r=0.9, p&lt;0.0001), suggesting that fingerstick samples are sufficient to quantitate the S-RBD BAU/mL. A moderate correlation was observed between FinecareTM and sVNT (r=0.5, p&lt;0.0001), indicating that FinecareTM can be used for rapid prediction of the neutralization antibody post-vaccination. FinecareTM BAU results showed strong correlation with VIDAS®3 (r=0.6, p&lt;0.0001), and moderate correlation with VITROS® (r=0.5, p&lt;0.0001), and CL-900i® (r=0.4, p&lt;0.0001), suggesting that FinecareTM be used as a surrogate for the advanced automated assays to measure S-RBD BAU/mL.Competing Interest StatementGKN would like to declare that all test kits used in this study were provided as in-kind support for his lab to test seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 and antibody response among vaccinated and infected individuals in Qatar.Funding StatementThis work was made possible by grant number UREP28-1733- 057 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation).

%X We develop a stochastic, multi-strain, compartmental epidemic model to estimate the relative transmissibility and immune escape of the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) in South Africa. The model integrates population, non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccines, and epidemiological data and it is calibrated in the period May 1st, 2021 – November 23rd, 2021. We explore a parameter space of relative transmissibility with respect to the Delta variant and immune escape for Omicron by assuming an initial seeding, from unknown origin, in the first week of October 2021. We identify a region of the parameter space where combinations of relative transmissibility and immune escape are compatible with the growth of the epidemic wave. We also find that changes in the generation time associated with Omicron infections strongly affect the results concerning its relative transmissibility. The presented results are informed by current knowledge of Omicron and subject to changes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementN.G. acknowledges support from the Doctoral Training Alliance.

%X The rapid spread and high transmissibility of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to lead to a significant number of key workers testing positive simultaneously.Under a policy of self-isolation after testing positive, this may lead to extreme staffing shortfalls at the same time as e.g. hospital admissions are peaking.Using a model of individual infectiousness and testing with lateral flow tests (LFT), we evaluate test-to-release policies against conventional fixed-duration isolation policies in terms of excess days of infectiousness, days saved, and tests used.We find that the number of infectious days in the community can be reduced to almost zero by requiring at least 2 consecutive days of negative tests, regardless of the number of days’ wait until testing again after initially testing positive.On average, a policy of fewer days’ wait until initiating testing (e.g 3 or 5 days) results in more days saved vs. a 10-day isolation period, but also requires a greater number of tests.Due to a lack of specific data on viral load progression, infectivity, and likelihood of testing positive by LFT over the course of an Omicron infection, we assume the same parameters as for pre-Omicron variants and explore the impact of a possible shorter proliferation phase.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementBJQ is supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1139859).

%X The Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) Ad26.COV2.S non-replicating viral vector vaccine has been widely deployed for COVID-19 vaccination programs in resource-limited settings. Here we confirm that neutralizing and binding responses to Ad26.COV2.S vaccination are stable for 6 months post-vaccination, when tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Secondly, using longitudinal samples from individuals who experienced clinically mild breakthrough infections 4 to 5 months after vaccination, we show dramatically boosted binding antibodies, Fc effector function and neutralization. These high titer responses are of similar magnitude to humoral immune responses measured in severely ill, hospitalized donors, and are cross-reactive against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the extremely neutralization resistant Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant that currently dominates global infections, as well as SARS-CoV-1. These data have implications for population immunity in areas where the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been widely deployed, but where ongoing infections continue to occur at high levels.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the South African Medical Research Council (grants 96825 and 96838).

%X The waning antibody levels after immunization and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) negatively impact the vaccine-induced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. In this extension to the phase 1 clinical study, we report the antibody durability until 180 days after the second dose of MVC-COV1901, and examined the reactogenicity and immunogenicity followed by a booster shot MVC-COV1901 administered to 45 healthy adults from 20 to 49 years of age on day 209. Adverse reactions after the booster dose were mostly mild and comparable to that of the first two doses. Neutralizing antibodies remained detectable on day 209 at 59.4, 79.4, and 113.2 (IU/mL) for low dose (LD), middle dose (MD), and high dose (HD) groups, respectively. At four weeks after the booster dose, neutralizing titers increased to 1719.6, 818.3, and 1345.6 for LD, MD, and HD groups, respectively. Our data also showed that three doses of MVC-COV1901-induced antibodies were still effective, albeit lowered neutralizing titers, against the Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementH.-Y.C. and C.E.L. are employees of Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation and have received grants from the Taiwan Centers of Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare.

%X Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted an urgent need to use infection testing databases to rapidly estimate effectiveness of prior infection in preventing reinfection (PES) by novel variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Methods Mathematical modeling was used to demonstrate the applicability of the test-negative, case-control study design to derive PES. Modeling was also used to investigate effects of bias in PES estimation. The test-negative design was applied to national-level testing data in Qatar to estimate PES for SARS-CoV-2 infection and to validate this design.Results Apart from the very early phase of an epidemic, the difference between the test-negative estimate for PES and the true value of PES was minimal and became negligible as the epidemic progressed. The test-negative design provided robust estimation of PES even when PES began to wane after prior infection. Assuming that only 25% of prior infections are documented, misclassification of prior infection status underestimated PES, but the underestimate was considerable only when &gt;50% of the population was ever infected. Misclassification of latent infection, misclassification of current active infection, and scale-up of vaccination all resulted in negligible bias in estimated PES. PES against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Beta variants was estimated at 97.0% (95% CI: 93.6-98.6) and 85.5% (95% CI: 82.4-88.1), respectively. These estimates were validated using a cohort study design.Conclusions The test-negative design offers a feasible, robust method to estimate protection from prior infection in preventing reinfection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementHHA acknowledges the joint support of Qatar University and Marubeni M-QJRC-2020-5.

%X The highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has been shown to evade a substantial fraction of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by current vaccines that encode the WA1/2020 Spike immunogen1, resulting in increased breakthrough infections and reduced vaccine efficacy. Cellular immune responses, particularly CD8+ T cell responses, are likely critical for protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 disease2-6. Here we show that cellular immunity induced by current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is highly cross-reactive against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccines demonstrated durable CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses that showed extensive cross-reactivity against both the Delta and Omicron variants, including in central and effector memory cellular subpopulations. Median Omicron-specific CD8+ T cell responses were 82-84% of WA1/2020-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These data suggest that current vaccines may provide considerable protection against severe disease with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant despite the substantial reduction of neutralizing antibody responses.Competing Interest StatementDHB is a co-inventor on provisional vaccine patents (63/121,482; 63/133,969; 63/135,182).

%X We reported the first map of vaccine stimulated RBD-specific antibody responses (IgG, IgM and IgA) against the Omicron variant. We generated the map using a protein microarray, by analyzing longitudinal sera collected spanning one year from individuals immunized with 3 doses of an inactivated virus vaccine. The IgG response to RBD-Omicron is: 1/3-1/5 that of RBD-wild type; ∼6x higher for the booster dose vs. the 2nd dose; and reaches the plateau in about two weeks after the booster dose, then drops ∼5x in another two weeks. Similar results were also obtained for IgM and IgA. Because of the high correlation between RBD-specific antibody response and the neutralization activity to authentic virus, we at least indirectly revealed the landscape of antibody protection against the Omicron variant throughout the vaccination stages. Our results strongly support the necessity of booster vaccination. However, post-booster vaccination may need to be considered.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was partially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China Grant (No.2016YFA0500600), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31970130).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of Institutional Ethics Review Committee of Foshan Fourth Hospital gave ethical approval for this work; Ethics committee/IRB of Ethics Commission of Shanghai Jiao Tong University gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background On 26 November 2021, the world health organization (WHO) designated the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named Omicron (WHO, 2021a). As of December 16, Omicron has been detected in 89 countries (WHO, 2021b). The thread posed by Omicron is highly uncertain.Methods and findings For the analysis of the impact of Omicron on infection pressure and hospitalization needs we developed an open-source stochastic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) fast-model for simulating the transmission in the transition stage from the prevailing variant (most often Delta) to Omicron. The model is capable to predict trajectories of infection pressure and hospitalization needs, considering (a) uncertainties for the (Omicron) parametrization, (b) pre-existing vaccination and/or partial immunity status of the population, and demographic specific aspects regarding reference hospitalization needs, (c) effects of mitigating measures including social distancing and accelerated vaccination (booster) campaigns.Conclusions The SIR model approach yields results in fair agreement with Omicron transmission characteristics observed in South Africa and prognosis results in Europe (UK and Netherlands). The equations underlying the SIR formulation allows to effectively explore the effect of Omicron parametrization on anticipated infection growth rates and hospitalization rates relative to the prevailing variant. The models are online available as open source on GitHub.One Sentence Summary fast-model for the impact of OmicronCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with enhanced disease severity in pregnant women. Despite the potential of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce severe disease, vaccine uptake remained relatively low among pregnant women. Just as coordinated messaging from the CDC and leading obstetrics organizations began to increase vaccine confidence in this vulnerable group, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VOC) including the Omicron VOC raised new concerns about vaccine efficacy, given their ability to escape vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. Early data point to a milder disease course following omicron VOC infection in vaccinated individuals. Thus, these data suggest that alternate vaccine induced immunity, beyond neutralization, may continue to attenuate omicron disease, such as antibody-Fc-mediated activity. However, whether vaccine induced antibodies raised in pregnancy continue to bind and leverage Fc-receptors remains unclear.Methods VOC including Omicron receptor binding domain (RBD) or full Spike specific antibody isotype binding titers and FcγR binding were analyzed in pregnant women after the full dose regimen of either Pfizer/BioNtech BNT62b2 (n=10) or Moderna mRNA-1273 (n=10) vaccination using a multiplexing Luminex assay.Findings Comparable, albeit reduced, isotype recognition was observed to the Omicron Spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) following both vaccines. Yet, despite the near complete loss of Fc-receptor binding to the Omicron RBD, Fc-receptor binding was largely preserved to the Omicron Spike.Interpretation Reduced binding titer to the Omicron RBD aligns with observed loss of neutralizing activity. Despite the loss of neutralization, preserved Omicron Spike recognition and Fc-receptor binding potentially continues to attenuate disease severity in pregnant women.Funding NIH and the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationCompeting Interest StatementG.A. is a founder and equity holder of Seromyx Systems, a company developing a platform technology that describes the antibody immune response.

%X The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus contains extensive sequence changes relative to the earlier arising B.1, B.1.1 and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants that have unknown effects on viral infectivity and response to existing vaccines. Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs), we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron showed 3-fold higher capsid assembly and cell entry relative to Delta, a property conferred by S and N protein mutations. Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had 15-fold lower efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations relative to the ancestral B.1 spike protein. A third dose of Pfizer vaccine elicited substantially higher neutralization titers against Omicron, resulting in detectable neutralizing antibodies in 8 out of 8 subjects compared to 1 out of 8 pre-boost. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody therapeutics Casirivimab and Imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B.1, B.1.1 or Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs. Our results suggest that Omicron is more efficient at assembly and cell entry compared to Delta, and the antibody response triggered by existing vaccines or previous infection, at least prior to boost, will have limited ability to neutralize Omicron.

%X Although SARS-CoV-2 infects the upper respiratory tract, we know little about the amount, type, and kinetics of antibodies (Ab) generated at this site in response to intramuscular COVID-19 vaccination, and whether these Ab protect against subsequent “breakthrough” infections. We collected longitudinal serum and saliva samples from participants receiving two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines over a 6-month period and measured the relative level of anti-Spike and anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) Ab. We detected anti-Spike/RBD IgG and IgA and associated secretory component in the saliva of most participants receiving 1 dose of mRNA vaccine. Administration of a second dose of mRNA boosted the IgG but not the IgA response, with only 30% of participants remaining positive for IgA at this timepoint. At 6 months post-dose 2, these participants exhibited greatly diminished anti-Spike/RBD IgG and IgA levels concomitant with a reduction in neutralizing activity in the saliva, although the level of secretory component associated anti-Spike was less susceptible to decay. Examining two prospective cohorts of subjects that were monitored for infections post-vaccination, we found that participants who were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 had lower levels of vaccine-induced serum anti-Spike/RBD IgA at 2-4 weeks post-dose 2 compared to participants who did not experience an infection, whereas IgG levels were comparable between groups. These data emphasize the importance of developing COVID-19 vaccines that elicit a durable IgA response.One-Sentence Summary Our study delves into whether intra-muscular mRNA vaccination regimes confer a local IgA response in the oral cavity and whether the IgA response is associated with protection against breakthrough infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by an Ontario Together province of Ontario grant to JG and ACG and a Foundation grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to JG (Fund #15992).

%X Background The immune profile against SARS-CoV-2 has dramatically diversified due to a complex combination of exposure to vaccines and infection by various lineages/variants, likely generating a heterogeneity in protective immunity in a given population. To further complicate this, the Omicron variant, with numerous spike mutations, has emerged. These circumstances have created the need to assess the potential of immune evasion by the Omicron in individuals with various immune histories.Methods The neutralization susceptibility of the variants including the Omicron and their ancestor was comparably assessed using a panel of plasma/serum derived from individuals with divergent immune histories. Blood samples were collected from either mRNA vaccinees or from those who suffered from breakthrough infections by the Alpha/Delta with multiple time intervals following vaccination.Findings The Omicron was highly resistant to neutralization in fully vaccinated individuals without a history of breakthrough infections. In contrast, robust cross-neutralization against the Omicron were induced in vaccinees that experienced breakthrough infections. The time interval between vaccination and infection, rather than the variant types of infection, was significantly correlated with the magnitude and potency of Omicron-neutralizing antibodies.Conclusions Immune histories with breakthrough infections can overcome the resistance to infection by the Omicron, with the vaccination-infection interval being the key determinant of the magnitude and breadth of neutralization. The diverse exposure history in each individual warrants a tailored and cautious approach to understanding population immunity against the Omicron and future variants.Funding This study was supported by grants from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by grants from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (Grant Numbers by JP21fk0108104, JP20fk0108534, and JP21fk0108615).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The medical research ethics committee of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Genome sequencing is pivotal to SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, elucidating the emergence and global dissemination of acquired genetic mutations. Amplicon sequencing has proven very effective for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, but prevalent mutations disrupting primer binding sites have necessitated the revision of sequencing protocols in order to maintain performance for emerging virus lineages. We compared the performance of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Midnight and ARTIC tiling amplicon protocols using 196 Delta lineage SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens, and 71 mostly Omicron lineage samples with S gene target failure (SGTF), reflecting circulating lineages in the United Kingdom during December 2021. 96-plexed nanopore sequencing was used. For Delta lineage samples, ARTIC v4 recovered the greatest proportion of ≥90% complete genomes (81.1%; 159/193), followed by Midnight (71.5%; 138/193) and ARTIC v3 (34.1%; 14/41). Midnight protocol however yielded higher average genome recovery (mean 98.8%) than ARTIC v4 (98.1%) and ARTIC v3 (75.4%), resulting in less ambiguous final consensus assemblies overall. Explaining these observations were ARTIC v4’s superior genome recovery in low viral titre/high cycle threshold (Ct) samples and inferior performance in high titre/low Ct samples, where Midnight excelled. We evaluated Omicron sequencing performance using a revised Midnight primer mix alongside prototype ARTIC v4.1 primers, head-to-head with the existing commercially available Midnight and ARTIC v4 protocols. The revised protocols both improved considerably the recovery of Omicron genomes and exhibited similar overall performance to one another. Revised Midnight protocol recovered ≥90% complete genomes for 85.9% (61/71) of Omicron samples vs. 88.7% (63/71) for ARTIC v4.1. Approximate cost per sample for Midnight (£12) is lower than ARTIC (£16) while hands-on time is considerably lower for Midnight (∼7 hours) than ARTIC protocols (∼9.5 hours).Competing Interest StatementSome Midnight sequencing kits used in this study were provided free of charge by Oxford Nanopore TechnologiesFunding StatementThis study is supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance (NIHR200915), a partnership between the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the University of Oxford.

%X Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that possess mutations associated with increased transmission and antibody escape have arisen over the course of the current pandemic. While the current vaccines have largely been effective against past variants, the number of mutations found on the Omicron (B.1.529) spike appear to diminish the efficacy of pre-existing immunity. Using pseudoparticles expressing the spike of several SARS-CoV-2 variants, we evaluated the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response over time in naturally infected and in mRNA-vaccinated individuals. We observed that while boosting increases the magnitude of the antibody response to wildtype (D614), Beta, Delta and Omicron variants, the Omicron variant was the most resistant to neutralization. We further observed that vaccinated healthy adults had robust and broad antibody responses while responses were relatively reduced in vaccinated pregnant women, underscoring the importance of learning how to maximize mRNA vaccine responses in pregnant populations. Findings from this study show substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude and breadth of responses after infection and mRNA vaccination and may support the addition of more conserved viral antigens to existing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.One Sentence Summary Diminished efficacy of pre-existing immunity to highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementConrad Prebys Foundation 204 (RHS, GST) Fast Grants (TTW) CEND COVID Catalyst Fund (TTW) Crown Foundation Sunshine Foundation Marino Family Foundation National Institutes of Health U19AI111825 (TTW) National Institutes of Health U54CA260517 (TTW) National Institutes of Health R01AI137365 (SV) National Institutes of Health R03AI146632 (SV) National Institutes of Health 75N93019C00076 (RHS) BARDA ASPR-20-01495 (MBF) Health and Human Services HHSN272201400008C / 0258-0686-4609 (MBF) Support for Stanford biobanking was supported in part by support from the Quattrone Family and from Fast Grants Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Approved by Institutional Review Board of Stanford University (IRB-556719 and IRB-8629) and the University of California at San Francisco Institutional Review Board (20-32077).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X In previously unvaccinated and uninfected individuals, non-RBD SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B cells were prominent in two distinct, durable, resting, cross-reactive, “pre-existing” switched memory B cell compartments. While pre-existing RBD-specific B cells were extremely rare in uninfected and unvaccinated individuals, these two pre-existing switched memory B cell compartments were molded by vaccination and infection to become the primary source of RBD-specific B cells that are triggered by vaccine boosting. The frequency of wild-type RBD-binding memory B cells that cross-react with the Omicron variant RBD did not alter with boosting. In contrast, after a boost, B cells recognizing the full-length Omicron variant spike protein expanded, with pre-existing resting memory B cells differentiating almost quantitatively into effector B cell populations. B cells derived from “ancient” pre-existing memory cells and that recognize the full-length wild-type spike with the highest avidity after boosting are the B cells that also bind the Omicron variant spike protein.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by NIH U19 AI110495 to SP and the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness and the UMASS Covid Research Fund.

%X The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In November 2021, the Omicron variant was discovered and classified as a variant of concern (VOC). Omicron shows substantially more mutations in the spike protein than any previous variant, mostly in the receptor binding domain (RBD). We analyzed the binding of the Omicron RBD to the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2) and the ability of human sera from COVID-19 patients or vaccinees in comparison to Wuhan, Beta or Delta RBDs variants.All RBDs were produced in insect cells. RBD binding to hACE2 was analyzed by ELISA and microscale thermophoresis (MST). Similarly, sera from 27 COVID-19 patients, 58 fully vaccinated individuals and 16 booster recipients were titrated by ELISA on the fixed RBDs from the original Wuhan strain, Beta, Delta and Omicron VOC.Surprisingly, the Omicron RBD showed a weaker binding to ACE2 compared to Beta and Delta, arguing that improved ACE2 binding is not a likely driver of Omicron evolution. Serum antibody titers were significantly lower against Omicron RBD compared to the original Wuhan strain. However, a difference of 2.5 times was observed in RBD binding while in other studies the neutralization of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by a magnitude of 10x and more. These results indicate an immune escape focused on neutralizing antibodies.The reduced binding of sera to Omicron RBD adds evidence that current vaccination protocols may be less efficient against the Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementM.S., F.B., S.S., S.D. and M.H. are inventors on a patent application on blocking antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

%X Background Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR), who typically receive post-transplant immunosuppression, show increased COVID-19-related mortality. It is unclear whether an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccines in SOTR can overcome the reduced immune responsiveness against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants.Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of 53 SOTR receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccination into a prospective cohort study performing detailed immunoprofiling of humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.Results Prior to the additional vaccine dose, 60.3% of SOTR showed no measurable neutralization and only 18.9% demonstrated neutralizing activity of &gt;90% following two vaccine doses. More intensive immunosuppression, antimetabolites in particular, negatively impacted antiviral immunity. While absolute IgG levels were lower in SOTR than controls, antibody titers against microbial recall antigens were in fact higher. In contrast, SOTR showed reduced vaccine-induced IgG/IgA antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and its delta variants. Vaccinated SOTR showed a markedly fewer linear B cell epitopes, indicating reduced B cell diversity. Importantly, a third vaccine dose led to an increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and neutralizing activity across alpha, beta and delta variants. However, we observed a significant decrease in anti-spike antibody titers with the omicron variant.Conclusions Only a small subgroup of SOTR generated functionally relevant antibodies after completing the initial vaccine series based on dysfunctional priming of immune responses against novel antigens. An additional dose of the vaccine results in dramatically improved antibody responses against all SARS-CoV-2 variants except omicron.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by two grants from the Kahlert Foundation.

%X Variants of SARS-CoV-2 may evade natural and vaccine induced immunity and monoclonal antibody immunotherapeutics. There is an urgent need to know how well antibodies, induced by healthy and Clinically Extremely Vulnerable (CEV) patients, will bind and thus help reduce transmission and severity of infection from variants of concern (VOC). This study determines the cross-reactive binding of serum antibodies obtained prior to and 28 days after a third vaccination in three cohorts; a health care worker cohort who received three doses of Pfizer-BioNtech (PPP), a cohort of CEV patients received two doses of the AstraZeneca-ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 (AAP) vaccine, followed by a third PFZ vaccine and a haemodialysis cohort that had a mixture of two AZ or PFZ vaccines followed by a PFZ booster. Six months post second vaccine there was evidence of antibody waning with 58.9% of individuals in the HD cohort seropositive against Wuhan, 34.4% Delta and 62.2% Omicron strains. For the AAP cohort, equivalent figures were 62.5%, 45.8% and 91.7% and the PPP cohort 92.2%, 90% and 91.1%. Post third dose vaccination there were universal increases in seropositivity and median optical density. For the HD cohort, 98.8% were seropositive to the Wuhan strain, 97.6% against Delta and 100% against Omicron strains. For the PPP and AAP cohorts, 100% were seropositive against all 3 strains. Lastly, we examined the WHO NIBSC 20/136 standard and there was no loss of antibody binding to either VOC. Similarly, a dilution series of Sotrovimab (GSK) found this therapeutic monoclonal antibody bound similarly to all VOC.HighlightsIgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike glycoprotein antibody levels were high in 100% of health care workers (HCW), a general practice population considered clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and haemodialysis patients (HD) 4 weeks after a third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose (Pfizer-BioNtech-PFZ).For both Delta and Omicron variant spike glycoproteins these antibody levels were highest in the CEV cohort who had previously received two doses of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AAP), lower in HCW who had previously received two doses of PFZ (PPP) and lowest in HD who had a mix of vaccines for the first and second dosePrior to this third vaccine dose and 6 months post second vaccine dose there was evidence of significant waning of antibodies against VOC.Competing Interest StatementMark Drayson and Tim Plant have shares in Abingdon HealthFunding StatementThe COCO/PITCH healthcare worker cohort was funded by the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Care and United Kingdom Research and Innovation COVID-19 Rapid Response Rolling Call as part of the PITCH Consortium.

%X Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) booster vaccination is being comprehensively evaluated globally due to waning immunity and the emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate antibody responses in individuals vaccinated with two doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccine and to explore the boosting effect of the different vaccine platforms in BBIBP-CorV-primed healthy adults, including viral vector vaccine (AZD122) and mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273). The results showed that, in the BBIBP-CorV prime group, the total receptor-binding domain (RBD) immuno-globulin (Ig) and anti-RBD IgG levels waned significantly at 3 months after receiving the second dose. However, after the booster, RBD-specific binding antibody levels increased. Neutralizing antibody measured by a surrogate neutralization test showed of inhibition over 90% against the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant but less than 70% against omicron variant after the third dose on day 28. All booster vaccines could induce the total IFN-□ T-cell response. The reactogenicity was acceptable and well tolerated without serious adverse events. This study supported administration of the third dose with either viral vector or mRNA vaccine for the BBIBP-CorV-primed individuals to stimulate antibody and T cell responses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialTCTR20211120002Funding StatementThis research was funded by a Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI), the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology of Chulalongkorn University/King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (GCE 59-009-30-005), the Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University to Jira Chansaenroj and MK Restaurant Group Public CompanyAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (IRB numbers 871/64)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and their concentration in sera of convalescents and vaccinees are a solid correlate of protection from COVID-19. The antibody concentrations in clinical samples that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 are difficult and very cumbersome to assess with conventional virus neutralization tests (cVNTs), which require work with the infectious virus and biosafety level 3 containment precautions. Alternative virus neutralization tests currently in use are mostly surrogate tests based on direct or competitive ELISA formats or use viral vectors with the spike protein as the single structural component of SARS-CoV-2. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a virus-free, safe and very fast (4.5 h) in vitro diagnostic test based on engineered yet authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (VLPs). They share all features of the original SARS-CoV-2 but lack the viral RNA genome and thus are non-infectious. NAbs induced by infection or vaccination, but also potentially neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can be reliably quantified and assessed with ease and within hours with our test, because they interfere and block the ACE2-mediated uptake of VLPs by recipient cells. Results from the VLP neutralization test (VLPNT) show excellent correlation to a cVNT with fully infectious SARS-CoV-2 and allow to estimate the reduced neutralization capacity of COVID-19 vaccinee sera with variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2.Author summary The current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a major challenge not only for COVID-19 patients, medical staff, healthcare systems and the general public, but also virologists and clinical laboratories. A particular challenge are safety issues which require biological safety level 3 to work with and study the pathogen. An alternative are virus-like particles (VLPs) of SARS-CoV-2, which are authentic in terms of viral structure and function but are harmless bioproducts in nature. We engineered VLPs which are close-to-perfect mimics of SARS-CoV-2 by all structural, biochemical, physical and functional criteria tested. SARS-CoV-2 VLPs were used in virus neutralization tests (VNTs). Because high concentrations of neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from COVID-19 practical VNTs are urgently needed. We developed an authentic, virus-free, thus safe yet very fast in vitro diagnostic test with SARS-CoV-2 VLPs. Virus neutralizing antibodies induced by natural infection or vaccination but also certain monoclonal antibodies inhibit VLP fusion with recipient cells carrying ACE2. Quantitative results from a conventional neutralization test with fully infectious SARS-CoV-2 and results from the VLP-based neutralization test correlate perfectly. The setup of the test is very flexible and allows to analyze sera for their neutralizing capacity against different variants of concern and in a standardized assay format.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research project was supported by LMUexcellent, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Free State of Bavaria under the Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the Laender.

%X Immunization against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) occurs via natural infection or vaccination. However, it is currently unknown how long infection- or vaccination-induced immunological memory will last. We performed a longitudinal evaluation of immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 following mRNA vaccination in naïve and COVID-19 recovered individuals. We found that cellular immunity is still detectable 8 months after vaccination, while antibody levels decline significantly especially in naïve subjects. We also found that a booster injection is more efficacious in reactivating immunological memory to spike protein in naïve than in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. Finally, we observed a similar kinetics of decay of humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 up to one year following natural infection in a cohort of unvaccinated individuals. Short-term persistence of humoral immunity may account for reinfections and breakthrough infections, although long-lived memory B and CD4+ T cells may protect from severe disease. A booster dose restores optimal anti-spike immunity in naïve subjects, while the need for vaccinated COVID-19 recovered subjects has yet to be defined.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by funds to the Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence (Project Excellence Departments 2018-2022), by the University of Florence, project RICTD2122, by the Italian Ministry of Health (COVID-2020-12371849) and by Tuscany Region (TagSARS CoV 2).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of Area Vasta Toscana Centro gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Since February 2021, health care workers in Japan have been preferentially vaccinated with a messenger RNA vaccine (BNT162b2/Pfizer) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While many studies have confirmed that this vaccine is highly effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), antibody titers tend to decline at 3 months, leading to a risk of breakthrough infections. Thus, information is needed to support decision making regarding the third vaccination. In this study, we investigated transition of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG and neutralizing antibody titers of 41 vaccinated Japanese healthcare workers. Samples were collected seven times starting 1 week before vaccination until 6 months post-vaccination. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels peaked at 7 days after the booster, then declined over time and decreased to &lt;10% at 6 months after the booster. Workers with low anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels also had low neutralizing antibody titers. These data support the active use of boosters for healthcare workers, especially for those with low anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of Nara Medical University gave ethical approval for this work (No. 3168).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Following its emergence in late November of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has caused major global public health concerns. We recently demonstrated that in healthy adults the Omicron variant exhibits strong resistance to immunity induced by two doses of the mRNA vaccines, but a booster mRNA vaccine dose can provide strong protection against Omicron. However, it is currently unknown how well these mRNA vaccine boosters protect immunocompromised groups, including cancer patients, from the Omicron variant. Here we show that (1) neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against the Delta and Omicron variants in cancer patients after two-dose mRNA vaccines are 4.2-fold and 21.3-fold lower, respectively, compared to the ancestral D614G, and (2) nAb titers against the Delta and Omicron variants in boosted cancer patients are 3.6-fold and 5.1-fold lower, respectively, compared to D614G. Our findings highlight the effectiveness and need for booster vaccination strategies in immunocompromised groups including cancer patients to protect from the Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a fund provided by an anonymous private donor to The Ohio State University to S.-L.L.

%X The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is raising concerns because of its increased transmissibility and by its numerous spike mutations with potential to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. The Dominican Republic was among the first countries in recommending the administration of a third dose COVID-19 vaccine to address potential waning immunity and reduced effectiveness against variants. Here, we evaluated the effects of a heterologous BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine booster on the humoral immunity of participants that had received a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine used globally. We found that heterologous CoronaVac prime followed by BNT162b2 booster regimen induces elevated virus-specific antibody levels and potent neutralization activity against the ancestral virus and Delta variant, resembling the titers obtained after two doses of mRNA vaccines. While neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in participants that had received a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac vaccine, BNT162b2 booster resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in neutralization activity against Omicron, compared to two-dose mRNA vaccine. Despite this increase, neutralizing antibody titers were reduced by 6.3-fold and 2.7-fold for Omicron compared to ancestral and Delta variant, respectively. Surprisingly, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection did not affect the neutralizing titers for Omicron in participants that received the heterologous regimen. Our findings have immediate implications for multiples countries that previously used a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac and reinforce the notion that the Omicron variant is associated with immune escape from vaccines or infection-induced immunity, highlighting the global need for vaccine boosters to combat the impact of emerging variants.Competing Interest StatementAkiko Iwasaki served as a consultant for Adaptive Biotechnologies.

%X The severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is spreading rapidly, even in vaccinated individuals, raising concerns about immune escape. Here, we studied neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 D614G (wildtype, WT), and the B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants of concern (VOC) in a cohort of 60 health care workers (HCW) after immunization with ChAdOx-1 S, Ad26.COV2.S, mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2. High binding antibody levels against WT SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) were detected 28 days after vaccination with both mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2), which significantly decreased after 6 months. In contrast, antibody levels were lower after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination but did not wane. Neutralization assays with authentic virus showed consistent cross-neutralization of the Beta and Delta variants in study participants, but Omicron-specific responses were significantly lower or absent (up to a 34-fold decrease compared to D614G). Notably, BNT162b2 booster vaccination after either two mRNA-1273 immunizations or Ad26.COV.2 priming partially restored neutralization of the Omicron variant, but responses were still up to-17-fold decreased compared to D614G. CD4+ T-cell responses were detected up to 6 months after all vaccination regimens; S-specific T-cell responses were highest after mRNA-1273 vaccination. No significant differences were detected between D614G- and variant-specific T-cell responses, including Omicron, indicating minimal escape at the T-cell level. This study shows that vaccinated individuals retain T-cell immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, potentially balancing the lack of neutralizing antibodies in preventing or limiting severe COVID-19. Booster vaccinations may be needed to further restore Omicron cross-neutralization by antibodies.Competing Interest StatementA.S. is a consultant for Gritstone Bio, Flow Pharma, Arcturus Therapeutics, ImmunoScape, CellCarta, Avalia, Moderna, Fortress and Repertoire.

%T Waning of SARS-CoV-2 booster viral-load reduction effectiveness

%X The BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to reduce viral load of breakthrough infections (BTIs), an important factor affecting infectiousness. This viral-load protective effect has been waning with time post the second vaccine and later restored with a booster shot. It is currently unclear though for how long this regained effectiveness lasts. Analyzing Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR tests of over 22,000 infections during a Delta-variant-dominant period in Israel, we found that this viral-load reduction effectiveness significantly declines within months post the booster dose. Adjusting for age, sex and calendric date, Ct values of RdRp gene initially increased by 2.7 [CI: 2.3-3.0] relative to unvaccinated in the first month post the booster dose, yet then decayed to a difference of 1.3 [CI: 0.7-1.9] in the second month and became small and insignificant in the third to fourth months. The rate and magnitude of this post-booster decline in viral-load reduction effectiveness mirror those observed post the second vaccine. These results suggest rapid waning of the booster’s effectiveness in reducing infectiousness, possibly affecting community-level spread of the virus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation KillCorona-Curbing Coronavirus Research Program (grant no. 3633/19 to R.

%X Background SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome needing intensive care admission and may lead to death. As a virus that transmits by respiratory droplets and aerosols, determining the duration of viable virus shedding from the respiratory tract is critical for patient prognosis, and informs infection control measures both within healthcare settings and the public domain.Methods We examined upper and lower airway respiratory secretions for both viral RNA and infectious virions in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Wales. Samples were taken from the oral cavity (saliva), oropharynx (sub-glottic aspirate), or lower respiratory tract (non-directed bronchoalveolar lavage (NBL) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) and analyzed by both qPCR and plaque assay.Results 117 samples were obtained from 25 patients. qPCR showed extremely high rates of positivity across all sample types, however live virus was far more common in saliva (68%) than in BAL/NBAL (32%). Average titres of live virus were higher in subglottic aspirates (4.5×107) than in saliva (2.2×106) or BAL/NBAL (8.5×106), and reached &gt;108 PFU/ml in some samples. The longest duration of shedding was 98 days, while the majority of patients (14/25) shed live virus for 20 days or longer.Conclusions Intensive care unit patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can shed high titres of virus both in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and tend to be prolonged shedders. This information is important for decision making around cohorting patients, de-escalation of PPE, and undertaking potential aerosol generating procedures.Summary Patients on intensive therapy infected with SARS-CoV-2 tend to be prolonged shedders, excreting virus for far beyond the time periods specified in current guidelines, and live virus titres can be extremely high in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by funding from the MRC (MR/V028448/1, MR/S00971X/1), Wellcome Trust (204870/Z/16/Z), Welsh Government Ser Cymru Scheme, and Accelerate Wales.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Sample collection (20th October to 8Th December 2020) was undertaken as a service evaluation to see if samples could be processed from the respiratory tract and virus measured as an alternative to qRT-PCR.

%X The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has multiple Spike (S) protein mutations that contribute to escape from the neutralizing antibody responses, and reducing vaccine protection from infection. The extent to which other components of the adaptive response such as T cells may still target Omicron and contribute to protection from severe outcomes is unknown. We assessed the ability of T cells to react with Omicron spike in participants who were vaccinated with Ad26.CoV2.S or BNT162b2, and in unvaccinated convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 70). We found that 70-80% of the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to spike was maintained across study groups. Moreover, the magnitude of Omicron cross-reactive T cells was similar to that of the Beta and Delta variants, despite Omicron harbouring considerably more mutations. Additionally, in Omicron-infected hospitalized patients (n = 19), there were comparable T cell responses to ancestral spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins to those found in patients hospitalized in previous waves dominated by the ancestral, Beta or Delta variants (n = 49). These results demonstrate that despite Omicron’s extensive mutations and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, the majority of T cell response, induced by vaccination or natural infection, cross-recognises the variant. Well-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron is likely to contribute to protection from severe COVID-19, supporting early clinical observations from South Africa.Competing Interest StatementA.

%X Reports suggest that COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is decreasing, either due to waning immune protection, emergence of new variants of concern, or both. Heterologous prime/boost vaccination with a vector-based approach (ChAdOx-1nCov-19, ChAd) followed by an mRNA vaccine (e.g. BNT162b2, BNT) appeared to be superior in inducing protective immunity, and large scale second booster vaccination is ongoing. However, data comparing declining immunity after homologous and heterologous vaccination as well as effects of a third vaccine application after heterologous ChAd/BNT vaccination are lacking. We longitudinally monitored immunity in ChAd/ChAd (n=41) and ChAd/BNT (n=88) vaccinated individuals and assessed the impact of a second booster with BNT in both groups. The second booster greatly augmented waning anti-spike IgG but only moderately increased spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in both groups to cell frequencies already present after the boost. More importantly, the second booster efficiently restored neutralizing antibody responses against Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, but neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529 (Omicron) stayed severely impaired. Our data suggest that inferior SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses after homologous ChAd/ChAd vaccination can be cured by a heterologous BNT vaccination. However, prior heterologous ChAd/BNT vaccination provides no additional benefit for spike-specific T cell immunity or neutralizing Omicron after the second boost.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the German Center for Infection Research TTU 01.938 (grant no 80018019238 to G.M.N.B and R.F.), and TTU 04.820 to G.M.N.B., by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, (DFG, German Research Foundation) Excellence Strategy EXC 2155 RESIST (Project ID39087428 to R.F.), by funds of the State of Lower Saxony (14-76103-184 CORONA-11/20 to R.F.), by funds of the BMBF (NaFoUniMedCovid19 FKZ: 01KX2021; Projects B-FAST to R.F.) and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, SFB 900/3 (Projects B1, 158989968 to R.F.), and the European Regional Development Fund (Defeat Corona, ZW7-8515131 and ZW7-85151373 to G.M.N.B.).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The CoCo Study and the analysis conducted for this article were approved by the Internal Review Board of Hannover Medical School (institutional review board no. 8973_BO-K_2020, amendment Dec 2020).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Convalescent plasma (CP) recurs as a frontline treatment in epidemics because it is available as soon as there are survivors. The COVID-19 pandemic represented the first large-scale opportunity to shed light into mechanisms of action, safety and efficacy of CP using modern evidence-based medicine approaches. Studies ranging from observational case series to randomized controlled trials (RCT) have reported highly variable efficacy results for COVID-19 CP (CCP), resulting in uncertainty. Reasons for CCP success and failure may be hidden in study details, which are usually difficult to explain to physicians and the public but provide fertile ground for designing next-generation studies. We analyzed variables associated with efficacy such as clinical settings, disease severity, CCP SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and function, dose, timing of administration (variously defined as time from onset of symptoms, molecular diagnosis, diagnosis of pneumonia, or hospitalization, or by serostatus), outcomes (defined as hospitalization, requirement for ventilation, clinical improvement or mortality), CCP provenance and time for collection, and criteria for efficacy. Focusing only on the results from the 30 available RCTs we noted that these were more likely to show signals of efficacy, including reductions in mortality, if the plasma neutralizing titer was ≥ 160 and the time to randomization was ≤ 9 days, consistent with passive antibody therapy efficacy requiring dosing with sufficient antibody. The fact that most studies revealed signals of efficacy despite variability in CCP and its use suggest likely therapeutic effects that become apparent despite the data noise. Despite the recent WHO guidelines discouraging CCP usage, the Omicron variant of concern is reminding us the superiority of polyclonal antibody therapies over monoclonal antibodies, and CCP from vaccinated convalescents is likely to be evaluated soonCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Not applicableI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Despite the dramatic spread of Omicron globally, even among highly vaccinated populations, death rates have not increased concomitantly. These data argue that alternative immune mechanisms, beyond neutralization, may continue to confer protection against severe disease. Beyond their ability to bind and block infection, antibodies contribute to control and clearance of multiple infections via their ability to direct antiviral immunity via Fc-effector mechanisms. Thus, here we probed the ability of vaccine induced antibodies, across three COVID-19 vaccines, to drive Fc-effector activity against Omicron. Despite the significant loss of IgM, IgA and IgG binding to the Omicron Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) across BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and CoronaVac vaccines, stable isotype binding was observed across all of these vaccines to the Omicron Spike. Compromised RBD binding IgG was accompanied by a significant loss of cross RBD-specific antibody Fcγ-receptor binding by the CoronaVac vaccine, but preservation of RBD-specific FcγR2a and Fcγ3a binding across the mRNA vaccines. Conversely, Spike-specific antibodies exhibited persistent binding to Fcγ-receptors, across all three vaccines, albeit higher binding was observed with the mRNA vaccines, marked by a selective preservation of FcγR2a and Fcγ3a binding antibodies. Thus, despite the significant to near complete loss of Omicron neutralization across several vaccine platforms against Omicron, vaccine induced Spike-specific antibodies continue to recognize the virus and recruit Fc-receptors pointing to a persistent capacity for extra-neutralizing antibodies to contribute Omicron disease attenuation.Competing Interest StatementG.A. is a founder and equity holder of Seromyx Systems, a company developing a platform technology that describes the antibody immune response.

%X Echinacea purpurea was shown to broadly inhibit coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This review discusses the available clinical evidence from randomized, blinded and controlled human studies. Two RCTs with results on enveloped viruses, respectively coronavirus infections during prevention treatment were detected. Incidence and/or viral loads were measured by RT-PCR and symptom severity was recorded. Jawad et al. (2012) collected nasopharyngeal swabs from adults (N=755) over 4 months of continuous prevention. Overall, 24 and 47 enveloped virus infections occurred, including 21 and 33 coronavirus detections [229E; HKU1; OC43] with Echinaforce® extract [2’400mg daily] and placebo, respectively (p=0.0114). Ogal et al. (2021) administered the same extract [1’200mg] or control for 4 months to children (4 – 12 years) (N=203). Echinacea reduced the incidence of enveloped virus infections from 47 to 29 (p=0.0038) whereas 11 and 13 coronavirus detections [229E, OC43, NL63] were counted (p&gt;0.05). Respiratory symptoms during coronavirus infections were significantly lower with area-under-curve AUC=75.8 (+/-50.24) versus 27.1 (+/-21.27) score points (p=0.0036). Importantly, viral loads in nasal secretions were significantly reduced by 98.5%, with Ct-values 31.1 [95% CI 26.3; 35.9] versus 25.0 [95% CI 20.5; 29.5] (p = 0.0479). Results from clinical studies confirm the antiviral activity found for Echinacea in vitro, embracing enveloped respiratory pathogens and therefore coronaviruses as well. Substantiating results from a new completed study seems to extrapolate these effects to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As hypothesized, the testified broad antiviral activity of Echinacea extract appears to be inclusive for SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementMO, AW, GG and PK declare no conflict of interest.

%X The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) with major spike protein mutations has raised concern over potential neutralization escape and breakthrough infections among vaccinated and previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. We measured cross-protective antibodies against variants in health care workers (HCW, n=20) and nursing home residents (n=9) from samples collected 1-2 months following the booster (3rd) dose. We also assessed the antibody responses in prior to Omicron era infected subjects (n=38) with subsequent administration of a single mRNA vaccine dose. Following booster vaccination HCWs had high IgG antibody concentrations to the spike protein and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were detectable against all variants. IgG concentrations among the elderly remained lower, and some lacked NAbs against the Beta and Omicron variants. NAb titers were significantly reduced against Delta, Beta and Omicron compared to wild-type virus regardless of age. Vaccination induced high IgG concentrations and variable titers of cross-reactive NAbs in previously infected subjects, whereas NAb titers against Omicron were barely detectable 1-month post-infection. High IgG concentrations with cross-protective neutralizing activity were detected after three COVID-19 vaccine doses in HCWs. However, lower NAb titers seen in the frail elderly suggest inadequate protection against Omicron breakthrough infections, yet protection against severe COVID-19 is expected.Clinical trial registration EudraCT 2021-004788-29Competing Interest StatementFinnish Institute for Health and Welfare has received research funding for unrelated studies from GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines (N.E., A.A.P. and M.M. as investigators), Pfizer (A.A.P.) and Sanofi Pasteur (A.A.P.).

%X Isolating, either enforced or self-guided, is a well-recognised and used technique in the limitation and reduction of disease spread. This usually balances the societal harm of disease transmission against the individual harm of being isolated and is typically limited to a very small number of individuals. With the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and requirements to self-isolate when symptomatic or having tested positive, the number of people affected has grown very large causing noticeable individual cost, and disruption to the provision of essential services. With widespread access to reliable rapid antigen tests (also known as LFD or LFTs), in this paper we examine strategies to utilise this testing technology to limit the individual harm whist maintaining the protective effect of isolation. We extend this work to examine how isolation may be improved and mitigate the release of infective individuals into the population caused by fixed time-periods.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X SARS-CoV-2 variants threaten the effectiveness of tools we have developed to mitigate against serious COVID-19. This is especially true in clinically vulnerable sections of society including the elderly. Using sera from BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccinated individuals aged between 70 and 89 (vaccinated with two doses 3-weeks apart) we examined the neutralising antibody (nAb) response to wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Between 3 and 20-weeks post 2nd dose, nAb titres dropped 4.9-fold to a median titre of 21.3 (ND80) with 21.6% of individuals having no detectable nAbs at the later time point. Experiments examining the neutralisation of twenty-one different SARS-CoV-2 variant spike proteins confirmed a significant potential for antigenic escape, especially for the Omicron (BA.1), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), Theta (P.3), C.1.2 and B.1.638 variants. Interestingly, however, the recently-emerged sub-lineage AY.4.2 was more efficiently neutralised than parental Delta pseudotypes. Combining pseudotype neutralisation with specific receptor binding domain (RBD) ELISAs we confirmed that changes to position 484 in the spike RBD were predominantly responsible for SARS-CoV-2 nAb escape, although the effect of spike mutations is both combinatorial and additive. Lastly, using sera from the same individuals boosted with a 3rd dose of BNT162b2 we showed that high overall levels of neutralising antibody titre can provide significant levels of cross-protection against Omicron. These data provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies wane over time and that antigenically variable SARS-CoV-2 variants are circulating, highlighting the importance of ongoing surveillance and booster programmes. Furthermore, they provide important data to inform risk assessment of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as Omicron, as they emerge.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the MRC funded G2P-UK National Virology Consortium; G2P-UK; A National Virology Consortium to address phenotypic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variation (MR/W005611/1).

%X The relationship of SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing results, viral load, and viral culture detection remains to be fully defined. Presumptively, viral culture can provide a surrogate measure for infectivity of sampled individuals, and thereby inform how and where to most appropriately deploy available diagnostic testing modalities. We therefore determined the relationship of antigen testing results from three lateral flow and one microfluidics assay to viral culture performed in parallel in 181 nasopharyngeal swab samples positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sample viral loads, determined by RT-qPCR, were distributed across the range of viral load values observed in our testing population. We found that antigen tests were predictive of viral culture positivity, with the LumiraDx method showing enhanced sensitivity (90%; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 83-94%) compared with the BD Veritor (74%, 95% CI 65-81%), CareStart (74%, 95% CI 65-81%) and Oscar Corona (74%, 95% CI 65-82%) lateral flow antigen tests. Antigen and viral culture positivity were also highly correlated with sample viral load, with areas under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (ROCs) of 0.94-0.97 and 0.92, respectively. In particular, a viral load threshold of 100,000 copies/mL was 95% sensitive (95% CI, 90-98%) and 72% specific (95% CI, 60-81%) for predicting viral culture positivity. Taken together, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen identified highly infectious individuals, some of whom may harbor 10,000-fold more virus in their samples than those with any detectable infectious virus. As such, our data support use of antigen testing in defining infectivity status at the time of sampling.Competing Interest StatementWe received support from Abbott Molecular unrelated to this study under a COVID-19 Diagnostics Evaluation Agreement. One co-author, RA, was also a recipient of grant support from Abbott Molecular under a clinical study agreement. LumiraDx, Oscar Medicare Pvt.

%X Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 results in protection from acquisition of infection as well as improved clinical outcomes even if infection occurs, likely reflecting a combination of residual vaccine-elicited immunity and the recall of immunological memory. Here, we define the early kinetics of spike-specific humoral and T cell immunity after vaccination of seropositive individuals, and after breakthrough infection in vaccinated individuals. Intensive and early longitudinal sampling reveals the timing and magnitude of recall, with the phenotypic activation of B cells preceding an increase in neutralizing antibody titres. In breakthrough infections, the delayed kinetics of humoral immune recall provides a mechanism for the lack of early control of viral replication but likely underpins accelerated viral clearance and the protective effects of vaccination against severe COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding Australian National Health and Medical Research Council grants 1149990, 1162760 and 2004398 Australian Medical Research Future Fund grants 2005544 and 2013870 The Victorian Government Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Investigator or Fellowship grants (MK, AWK, JAJ, H-XT, DAW, MPD, SJK) Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocols were approved by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (2021-21198-15398-3, 2056689), and all associated procedures were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines.

%T An <em>in silico</em> analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.529 (Omicron) genomic sequences and their epidemiological correlates

%X Background A newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.529 has worried the health policy makers worldwide due to the presence of a large number of mutations in its genomic sequence, especially in the spike protein region. World Health Organization (WHO) has designated it as a global variant of concern (VOC) and has named as ‘Omicron’. A surge in new COVID-19 cases have been reported from certain geographical locations, primarily in South Africa (SA) following the emergence of Omicron.Materials and methods We performed an in silico analysis of the complete genomic sequences of Omicron available on GISAID (until 2021-12-10) to predict the functional impact of the mutations present in this variant on virus-host interactions in terms of viral transmissibility, virulence/lethality, and immune escape. The mutations present at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the variants were assessed using an open analysis pipeline which integrates a yeast-display platform with deep mutational scanning. Further, we performed a correlation analysis of the relative proportion of the genomic sequences of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants (in the period of 01 Oct-10th Dec, 2021) with the current epidemiological data (new COVID-19 cases and deaths) from SA to understand whether the Omicron has an epidemiological advantage over existing variants.Results Compared to the current list of global VOCs/VOIs (as per WHO) Omicron bears more sequence variation, specifically in the spike protein and host receptor-binding motif (RBM). Omicron showed the closest nucleotide and protein sequence homology with Alpha variant for the complete sequence as well as for RBM. The mutations were found primarily condensed in spike region (28-48) of the virus. Further, the mutational analysis showed enrichment for the mutations decreasing ACE2-binding affinity and RBD protein expression, in contrast, increasing the propensity of immune escape. An inverse correlation of Omicron with Delta variant was noted (r=-0.99, p&lt; .001, 95% CI: -0.99 to - 0.97) in the sequences reported from SA post-emergence of the new variant, later showing a decrease. There has been a steep rise in the new COVID-19 cases in parallel with increase in the proportion of Omicron since the first case (74-100%), on the contrary, the incidences of new deaths have not been increased (r=-0.04, p&gt;0.05, 95% CI =-0.52 to 0.58).Conclusions Omicron may have greater immune escape ability than the existing VOCs/VOIs. However, there are no clear indications coming out from the predictive mutational analysis that the Omicron may have higher virulence/lethality than other variants, including Delta. The higher ability for immune escape may be a likely reason for the recent surge in Omicron cases in SA.HighlightsHigher immune escape ability than the existing VOCs/VOIsNo clear indications of increased affinity for ACE2 bindingDriving a new COVID-19 wave in South AfricaOutcompeting Delta variantCurrently, no clear evidence for increased virulence/lethalityCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:1.

%X The wide spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants with phenotypes impacting transmission and antibody sensitivity necessitates investigation of the immune response to different spike protein versions. Here, we compare the neutralization of variants of concern, including B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) in sera from individuals exposed to variant infection, vaccination, or both. We demonstrate that neutralizing antibody responses are strongest against variants sharing certain spike mutations with the immunizing exposure. We also observe that exposure to multiple spike variants increases the breadth of variant cross-neutralization. These findings contribute to understanding relationships between exposures and antibody responses and may inform booster vaccination strategies.SUMMARY This study characterizes neutralization of eight different SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta and Omicron, with respect to nine different prior exposures, including vaccination, booster, and infections with Delta, Epsilon, and others. Different exposures were found to confer substantially differing neutralization specificity.Competing Interest StatementDr. DeRisi is a member of the scientific advisory board of The Public Health Company, Inc., and is scientific advisor for Allen &amp; Co.

%X Numerous studies have shown that a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection can greatly enhance the antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination, with this so called “hybrid immunity” leading to greater neutralization breadth against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. However, little is known about how breakthrough infection (BTI) in COVID-19 vaccinated individuals will impact the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response. Here, we compared neutralizing antibody responses between unvaccinated and COVID-19 double vaccinated individuals (including both AZD1222 and BNT162b2 vaccinees) who have been infected with the delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Rapid production of Spike-reactive IgG was observed in the vaccinated group providing evidence of effective vaccine priming. Overall, potent cross-neutralizing activity against current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern was observed in the BTI group compared to the infection group, including neutralization of the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. This study provides important insights into population immunity where transmission levels remain high and in the context of new or emerging variants of concern.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by; Fondation Dormeur, Vaduz for funding equipment to KJD, Huo Family Foundation Award to MHM, KJD, MRC Genotype–to–Phenotype UK National Virology Consortium (MR/W005611/1 to MHM, KJD), and Wellcome Trust Investigator Award 106223/Z/14/Z to MHM.

%X The B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in November of 2021 in South Africa and Botswana as well as in a sample of a traveler from South Africa in Hong Kong.1,2 Since then, B.1.1.529 has been detected in many countries globally. This variant seems to be more infectious than B.1.617.2 (Delta), has already caused super spreader events3 and has outcompeted Delta within weeks in several countries and metropolitan areas. B.1.1.529 hosts an unprecedented number of mutations in its spike gene and early reports have provided evidence for extensive immune escape and reduced vaccine effectiveness.2,4-6 Here, we investigated the neutralizing and binding activity of sera from convalescent, mRNA double vaccinated, mRNA boosted as well as convalescent double vaccinated and convalescent boosted individuals against wild type, B.1.351 and B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralizing activity of sera from convalescent and double vaccinated participants was undetectable to very low against B.1.1.529 while neutralizing activity of sera from individuals who had been exposed to spike three or four times was maintained, albeit at strongly reduced levels. Binding to the B.1.1.529 receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) was reduced in convalescent not vaccinated but was mostly retained in vaccinated individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which list Florian Krammer as co-inventor.

%X A new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, Omicron (B.1.1.529), has been identified based on genomic sequencing and epidemiological data in South Africa. Presumptive Omicron cases in South Africa have grown extremely rapidly, despite high prior exposure and moderate vaccination coverage. The available evidence suggests that Omicron spread is at least in part due to evasion of this immune protection, though Omicron may also exhibit higher intrinsic transmissibility. Using detailed laboratory and epidemiological data from South Africa, we estimate the constraints on these two characteristics of the new variant and their relationship. Our estimates and associated uncertainties provide essential information to inform projection and scenario modeling analyses, which are crucial planning tools for governments around the world.One Sentence Summary We report a region of plausibility for the relative transmissibility and immune escape characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant estimated by integrating laboratory and epidemiological data from South Africa.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCABP is supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (NTD Modelling Consortium OPP1184344).

%X COVID-19 vaccination campaign has been launched around the world. More than 8 billion vaccines doses have been administered, according to the WHO. Published studies shows that vaccination reduces the number of COVID-19 cases and dramatically reduces COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths worldwide. In turn, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S glycoprotein poses risks of diminishing the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign. In November 2021, the first information appeared about a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was named Omicron. The Omicron variant is of concern because it contains a large number of mutations, especially in the S glycoprotein (16 mutation in RBD), which could be associated with resistance to neutralizing antibodies (NtAB) and significantly reduce the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. Neutralizing antibodies are one of the important parameters characterizing the protective properties of a vaccine. We conducted a study of neutralizing antibodies in the blood serum of people vaccinated with Sputnik V, as well as those revaccinated with Sputnik Light after Sputnik V. Results showed that a decrease in the level of neutralizing antibodies was observed against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in comparison to B.1.1.1 variant. Analysis of the sera of individuals vaccinated with Sputnik V 6-12 months ago showed that there was a decrease in the level of neutralizing antibodies by 11.76 folds. While no direct comparison with other vaccines declines has been done in this study, we note their reported decline in antibody neutralization at a much more significant level of 40-84 times. At the same time, the analysis of sera of individuals who were vaccinated with Sputnik V, and then revaccinated Sputnik Light, showed that 2-3 months after revaccination the decrease in the level of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant was 7.13 folds. Despite the decrease in NtAb, we showed that all revaccinated individuals had NtAb to Omicron variant. Moreover, the NtAb level to Omicron variant in revaccinated sera are slightly higher than NtAb to B.1.1.1 in vaccinated sera.Competing Interest StatementDIV, DAS, EAS, IFM, GDM, BAG, SDV, TAI, ZOV, LDY and GAL report patents for a Sputnik V immunobiological expression vector, pharmaceutical agent, and its method of use to prevent COVID-19.

%X Importance Screening and vaccination are essential in the fight against infectious diseases, but need to be integrated and customized based on community and disease characteristics.Objective To develop effective screening and vaccination strategies, customized for a college campus, to reduce COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and peak hospitalizations.Design, Setting, and Participants We construct a compartmental model of disease spread for vaccination and routine screening, and study the efficacy of four mitigation strategies (routine screening only, vaccination only, vaccination with partial routine screening, vaccination with full routine screening), and a no-intervention strategy. The study setting is a hypothetical college campus of 5,000 students and 455 faculty members, with 11 undetected, asymptotic SARS-CoV-2 infections at the start of an 80-day semester. For sensitivity analysis, we vary the screening frequency, daily vaccination rate, initial vaccination coverage, and screening and vaccination compliance; and consider three scenarios that represent low/medium/high transmission rates and test efficacy. Model parameters come from publicly available or published sources.Results With low initial vaccination coverage, even aggressive vaccination and screening result in a high number of infections: 1,024/2,040 (1,532/1,773) with routine daily (every other day) screening of the unvaccinated; 275/895 with daily screening extended to the newly vaccinated in base- and worst-case scenarios, with reproduction numbers 4.75 and 6.75, respectively, representative of COVID-19 Delta variant. With the emergence of the Omicron variant, the reproduction number may increase and/or effective vaccine coverage may decrease if a booster shot is needed to maximize vaccine efficacy.Conclusion Integrated vaccination and routine screening can allow for a safe opening of a college when initial vaccination coverage is sufficiently high. The interventions need to be customized considering the initial vaccination coverage, estimated compliance, screening and vaccination capacity, disease transmission and adverse outcome rates, and the number of infections/peak hospitalizations the college is willing to tolerate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%T Quarantine and testing strategies to ameliorate transmission due to travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: a modelling study

%X Background Numerous countries imposed strict travel restrictions, contributing to the large socioeconomic burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. The long quarantines that apply to contacts of cases may be excessive for travel policy.Methods We developed an approach to evaluate imminent countrywide COVID-19 infections after 0–14-day quarantine and testing. We identified the minimum travel quarantine duration such that the infection rate within the destination country did not increase compared to a travel ban, defining this minimum quarantine as “sufficient.”Findings We present a generalised analytical framework and a specific case study of the epidemic situation on November 21, 2021, for application to 26 European countries. For most origin-destination country pairs, a three-day or shorter quarantine with RT-PCR or antigen testing on exit suffices. Adaptation to the European Union traffic-light risk stratification provided a simplified policy tool. Our analytical approach provides guidance for travel policy during all phases of pandemic diseases.Interpretation For nearly half of origin-destination country pairs analysed, travel can be permitted in the absence of quarantine and testing. For the majority of pairs requiring controls, a short quarantine with testing could be as effective as a complete travel ban. The estimated travel quarantine durations are substantially shorter than those specified for traced contacts.Funding EasyJet (JPT and APG), the Elihu endowment (JPT), the Burnett and Stender families’ endowment (APG), the Notsew Orm Sands Foundation (JPT and APG), the National Institutes of Health (MCF), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (SMM) and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada EIDM-MfPH (SMM).Evidence before this study Evidence from early in the pandemic indicates that border closures at the epicentre slowed global dissemination of COVID-19. As community transmission became established in many nations, studies have suggested that the benefit of strict border closures in mitigating the transmission of disease from travellers diminished. Research for community settings has shown that testing later during quarantine, rather than upon entry into quarantine, can substantially shorten the duration of quarantine needed to reduce post-quarantine transmission. In particular for international air travellers, a 14-day quarantine can effectively be shortened to five or seven days. The number of infectious COVID-19 cases that escape from these quarantines depends on the prevalence of disease in the country the traveller originated as well as the travel volume into the country.Added value of this study We developed a framework to identify quarantine and testing strategies that enable travel from specific origins without increasing their infection rates per capita within destinations. No prior study has evaluated the appropriate duration of quarantine necessary to prevent any rise in infection rates per capita in the destination countries as a result of travel. By accounting for prevalence, daily incidence, vaccine coverage, immunity, age demographics, and travel flow between countries, we quantified the contribution of travel towards within-country the imminent infections in the destination country under different quarantine and testing strategies. For travel between 26 European countries, our results for the pandemic situation observed on November 21, 2021 demonstrate that there are often less burdensome quarantine and testing strategies that can serve as effective alternatives to strict border closure. Specifically, these estimated sufficient quarantine durations are especially dependent on COVID-19 prevalence and immunity within the two countries. We also found that asymmetry in the travel flow, just not the volume of travel flow, can also influence the estimated sufficient quarantine durations. Using data on variants of concern, including Omicron, we found that the adequacy of a border control strategy to limit variant spread depends strongly on the geographical distribution of the variant. While our results pertain to European countries, we also provide an interactive spreadsheet that can be used to determine appropriate quarantine durations between any two countries. Moreover, our framework can also be applied at any spatial or population scale within which movement restrictions could feasibly be implemented.Implications of all available evidence Travel quarantine and testing strategies can effectively mitigate importation and onward transmission within a country. Identifying sufficient strategies can allow countries to permit travel to and from other countries, without risking a short-term increase in infection rates. As long as the community transmission is occurring, the long-term epidemic trend within the destination country is more apt to be determined by other disease control measures, e.g., contact tracing, vaccination, and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Together, travel quarantine and other related control measures can mitigate the risk of transmission between countries, limiting the threat of variants of concern.Competing Interest StatementJPT and APG declare the following competing interests: received funding from EasyJet to conduct research on travel quarantine durations.

%X Human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emergent variants of concern has continued to occur globally, despite mass vaccination campaigns. Public health strategies to reduce virus spread should therefore rely, in part, on frequent screening with rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive tests. We evaluated two digitally integrated rapid tests and assessed their performance using stored nasal swab specimens collected from individuals with or without COVID-19. An isothermal amplification assay combined with a lateral flow test had a limit of detection of 10 RNA copies per reaction, and a positive percent agreement (PPA)/negative percent agreement (NPA) during the asymptomatic and symptomatic phases of 100%/100% and 95.83/100%, respectively. Comparatively, an antigen-based lateral flow test, had a limit of detection of 30,000 copies, and a PPA/NPA during the asymptomatic and symptomatic phases of 82.86%/98.68% and 91.67/100%, respectively. Both the isothermal amplification and antigen-based lateral flow tests had optimized detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the peak period of transmission; however, the antigen-based test had reduced sensitivity in clinical samples with qPCR Ct values greater than 29.8. Low-cost, high-throughput screening enabled by isothermal amplification or antigen-based techniques have value for outbreak control.Competing Interest StatementNS, BFS, and BBH are employed by E25Bio, Inc., a company that develops rapid diagnostic tests for infectious diseases.

%X The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, first identified in Botswana and South Africa, may compromise vaccine effectiveness and the ability of antibodies triggered by previous infection to protect against re-infection (1). Here we investigated whether Omicron escapes antibody neutralization in South Africans, either previously SARS-CoV-2 infected or uninfected, who were vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2. We also investigated if Omicron requires the ACE2 receptor to infect cells. We isolated and sequence confirmed live Omicron virus from an infected person in South Africa and compared plasma neutralization of this virus relative to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain with the D614G mutation, observing that Omicron still required ACE2 to infect. For neutralization, blood samples were taken soon after vaccination, so that vaccine elicited neutralization was close to peak. Neutralization capacity of the D614G virus was much higher in infected and vaccinated versus vaccinated only participants but both groups had 22-fold Omicron escape from vaccine elicited neutralization. Previously infected and vaccinated individuals had residual neutralization predicted to confer 73% protection from symptomatic Omicron infection, while those without previous infection were predicted to retain only about 35%. Both groups were predicted to have substantial protection from severe disease. These data support the notion that high neutralization capacity elicited by a combination of infection and vaccination, and possibly boosting, could maintain reasonable effectiveness against Omicron. A waning neutralization response is likely to decrease vaccine effectiveness below these estimates. However, since protection from severe disease requires lower neutralization levels and involves T cell immunity, such protection may be maintained.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates award INV-018944 (AS), National Institutes of Health award R01 AI138546 (AS), and South African Medical Research Council awards (AS, TdO, PLM).

%X The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants complicates efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative for early detection of emerging variants, to trace the movement of variants, and to monitor effectiveness of countermeasures. Additionally, determining the amount of viable virus present in clinical samples is helpful to better understand the impact these variants have on viral shedding. In this study, we analyzed nasal swab samples collected between March 2020 and early November 2021 from a cohort of United States (U.S.) military personnel and healthcare system beneficiaries stationed worldwide as a part of the Defense Health Agency’s (DHA) Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) program. SARS-CoV-2 quantitative real time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) positive samples were characterized by next-generation sequencing and a subset was analyzed for isolation and quantification of viable virus. Not surprisingly, we found that the Delta variant is the predominant strain circulating among U.S. military personnel beginning in July 2021 and primarily represents cases of vaccine breakthrough infections (VBIs). Among VBIs, we found a 50-fold increase in viable virus in nasal swab samples from Delta variant cases when compared to cases involving other variants. Notably, we found a 40-fold increase in viable virus in nasal swab samples from VBIs involving Delta as compared to unvaccinated personnel infected with other variants prior to the availability of approved vaccines. This study provides important insight about the genomic and virological characterization of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from a unique study population with a global presence.Impact The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a leading cause of death globally and new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge. Genomic surveillance of variants is necessary to characterize mutations that could affect transmissibility and spread, antigenicity or virulence. Furthermore, wet lab studies are necessary to evaluate how genetic differences may affect viral fitness and transmissibility. The Delta variant is currently the predominant strain globally and determining factors that drive its ability to spread rapidly is important. In this study, we characterized SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from U.S. military personnel and their beneficiaries by next-generation sequencing and isolation of viable virus. Consistent with other studies, we found higher levels of infectious virus from Delta samples when compared to non-Delta infections. Strikingly, we found the difference in titer between Delta and other strains to be so profound as to be unaffected by vaccination status, suggesting that increased transmissibility of the Delta variant is in part due to higher amounts of virus shedding. This helps explain the rapid spread of the Delta variant and provides the impetus to increase control measures such as vaccination, boosters, masking and distancing requirements. It will be necessary to continue genomic and virological characterization of new variants, such as Omicron.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division (AFHSD), Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) Branch, ProMIS IDs P0013_AH_01.01, P0166_20_NM, P0093_21_NM, and P0199_21_NM to KABL as well as Navy Work Unit Number (WUN) A1417.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:IRB of Naval Medical Research Center gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X We assess the potential consequences of the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 waves caused by the Omicron variant. Our results suggest that even in those regions where the Delta variant is controlled at the moment by a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions and population immunity, a significant Omicron wave can be expected. We stratify the population according to prior immunity status, and characterize the possible outbreaks depending on the population level of pre-existing immunity and the immune evasion capability of Omicron. We point out that two countries having similar effective reproduction numbers for the Delta variant can experience very different Omicron waves in terms of peak time, peak size and total number of infections among the high risk population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementHungarian National Research, Development, and Innovation Office (NKFIH)Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a clear need for high-throughput, multiplexed, and sensitive assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses as well as their emerging variants. Here, we present microfluidic CARMEN (mCARMEN), a cost-effective virus and variant detection platform that combines CRISPR-based diagnostics and microfluidics with a streamlined workflow for clinical use. We developed the mCARMEN respiratory virus panel (RVP) and demonstrated its diagnostic-grade performance on 533 patient specimens in an academic setting and then 166 specimens in a clinical setting. We further developed a panel to distinguish 6 SARS-CoV-2 variant lineages, including Delta and Omicron, and evaluated it on 106 patient specimens, with near-perfect concordance to sequencing-based variant classification. Lastly, we implemented a combined Cas13 and Cas12 approach that enables quantitative measurement of viral copies in samples. mCARMEN enables high-throughput surveillance of multiple viruses and variants simultaneously.Competing Interest StatementN.L.W., S.G.T., C.M.A., D.T.H., P.C.B., P.C.S., and C.M. are co-inventors on a patent related to this work.

%X Genetically distinct viral variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recorded since January 2020. Over this time global vaccine programs have been introduced, contributing to lowered COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality rates, particularly in the first world. In late 2021, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) virus variant emerged, with significant genetic differences and clinical effects from other variants of concern (VOC). This variant demonstrated higher numbers of polymorphisms in the gene encoding the Spike (S) protein, and there has been displacement of the dominant Delta variant. We assessed the impact of Omicron infection on the ability of: serum from vaccinated and / or previously infected individuals; concentrated human IgG from plasma donors, and licensed monoclonal antibody therapies to neutralise virus in vitro. There was a 17 to 22-fold reduction in neutralisation titres across all donors who had a detectable neutralising antibody titre to the Omicron variant. Concentrated pooled human IgG from convalescent and vaccinated donors had greater breadth of neutralisation, although the potency was still reduced 16-fold. Of all therapeutic antibodies tested, significant neutralisation of the Omicron variant was only observed for Sotrovimab, with other monoclonal antibodies unable to neutralise Omicron in vitro. These results have implications for ongoing therapy of individuals infected with the Omicron variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by The University of New South Wales Rapid Response grant (Australia, ADK), the Medical Research Future Fund COVID-19 grant (MRFF2005760, SGT), Medical Research Future Fund Antiviral Development Call grant (DC), Medical Research Future Fund COVID-19 grant (MRFF2001684, ADK), the New South Wales Health COVID-19 Research Grants Round 2 (FB).

%T Interdependencies between cellular and humoral immune responses in heterologous and homologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination

%X Background Homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2-vaccinations yield different spike protein-directed humoral and cellular immune responses. However, their interdependencies remain elusive.Methods COV-ADAPT is a prospective, observational cohort study of 417 healthcare workers who received homologous vaccination with Astra (ChAdOx1-S; AstraZeneca) or BNT (BNT162b2; Biontech/Pfizer) or heterologous vaccination with Astra/BNT. We assessed the humoral (anti-spike-RBD-IgG, neutralizing antibodies, antibody avidity) and cellular (spike-induced T cell interferon-γ release) immune response in blood samples up to 2 weeks before (T1) and 2 to 12 weeks following secondary immunization (T2).Findings Initial vaccination with Astra resulted in lower anti-spike-RBD-IgG responses compared to BNT (70±114 vs. 226±279 BAU/ml, p&lt;0.01) at T1, whereas T cell activation did not differ significantly. Booster vaccination with BNT proved superior to Astra at T2 (anti-spike-RBD-IgG: Astra/BNT 2387±1627 and BNT/BNT 3202±2184 vs. Astra/Astra 413±461 BAU/ml, both p&lt;0.001; spike-induced T cell interferon-γ release: Astra/BNT 5069±6733 and BNT/BNT 4880±7570 vs. Astra/Astra 1152±2243 mIU/ml, both p&lt;0.001). No significant differences were detected between BNT-boostered groups at T2. For Astra, we observed no booster effect on T cell activation. We found associations between anti-spike-RBD-IgG levels (Astra/BNT and BNT/BNT) and T cell responses (Astra/Astra and Astra/BNT) from T1 to T2. There were also links between levels of anti-spike-RBD-IgG and T cell at both time points (all groups combined). All regimes yielded neutralizing antibodies and increased antibody avidity at T2.Interpretation Interdependencies between humoral and cellular immune responses differ between common SARS-CoV-2 vaccination regimes. T cell activation is unlikely to compensate for poor humoral responses.Funding Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), ER723/3-1Evidence before this study We searched Pubmed for papers published between 01/01/2019 and 14/05/2021 with the search terms “covid-19” combined with “vaccination” and “heterologous”, excluding “BCG”. Of the 41 papers found, none addressed the combination of ChAdOx1-S by AstraZeneca (Astra) and BNT162b2 by Biontech/Pfizer (BNT). After our study was initiated, the CombiVacS trial reported a significant booster effect when BNT was given after initial vaccination with Astra.1 The investigators of the CoCo trial subsequently published data on heterologous immunization in comparison to homologous Astra in a small population (n=87), with the heterologous immunization scheme showing a superior humoral and cellular immune response.2 Further studies investigated heterologous vaccinations with Astra and BNT as well as homologous Astra and BNT regimes and also found superior humoral and cellular immune responses in the heterologous regimes compared to homologous Astra, and comparable or slightly superior immune responses when compared to homologous BNT vaccination.3–6 The body of research covering the effects of heterologous immunization regimes has recently been aggregated in a systematic review.7Added value of this study To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the interdependencies of cellular and humoral immune responses following heterologous vaccination with Astra/BNT in a large group of individuals. Our data show strong correlations between humoral and cellular immune responses with the prime-boost combination Astra/BNT. The findings suggest that individuals with a robust initial response developed strong humoral and cellular immune responses after booster immunization.Implications of all the available evidence Our study and the available data suggest that due to its superior capacity to elicit a humoral and cellular immune response, mRNA-based vaccines such as BNT should be chosen for booster vaccination rather than Astra. This seems to be particularly important in individuals whose immune response was poor after initial vaccination with Astra.We demonstrate here an association between humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination. Our findings suggest that distinct differences between common COVID-19 vaccination regimes should be taken into account in population-based vaccine programs. The present data indicate that a poor humoral immune response is unlikely to be mitigated by a strong cellular immune response.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementLuise Erpenbeck received funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), ER 723/3-1Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of the University Medical Center Goettingen gave ethical approval for this work (21/5/21)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, Omicron (B.1.1.529) contains about 30 mutations in the spike protein and the numerous mutations raise the concern of escape from vaccine, convalescent sera and therapeutic drugs. Here we analyze the alteration of their neutralizing titer with Omicron pseudovirus. Sera of 3 months after double BNT162b2 vaccination exhibite ∼27-fold lower neutralization titers against Omicron than D614G mutation. Neutralization titer is also reduced in convalescent sera from Alpha and Delta patients. However, some Delta patients have relatively preserved neutralization activity up to the level of 3-month double BNT162b2 vaccination. Omicron escapes from the cocktail of imdevimab and casirivimab, whereas sotrovimab that targets the conserved region to prevent viral escape is effective to Omicron similarly to the original SARS-CoV-2. The ACE2 decoy is another modality that neutralize the virus independently of mutational escape and Omicron is also sensitive to the engineered ACE2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Medical Research and Development (AMED), Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases under 21fk0108465h0001.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Clinical Research Review Committee in Kyoto Prefectural University of medicine gave ethical approval for this work.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is causing a rapid increase in infections in various countries. This new variant of concern carries an unusually high number of mutations in key epitopes of neutralizing antibodies on the spike glycoprotein, suggesting potential immune evasion. Here we assessed serum neutralizing capacity in longitudinal cohorts of vaccinated and convalescent individuals, as well as monoclonal antibody activity against Omicron using pseudovirus neutralization assays. We report a near-complete lack of neutralizing activity against Omicron in polyclonal sera after two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, in convalescent individuals, as well as resistance to different monoclonal antibodies in clinical use.

%X Recent surveillance has revealed the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (BA.1/B.1.1.529) harboring up to 36 mutations in spike protein, the target of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. Given its potential to escape vaccine-induced humoral immunity, we measured neutralization potency of sera from 88 mRNA-1273, 111 BNT162b, and 40 Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients against wild type, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We included individuals that were vaccinated recently (&lt;3 months), distantly (6-12 months), or recently boosted, and accounted for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinated individuals. However, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron only 4-6-fold lower than wild type, suggesting that boosters enhance the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, we find Omicron pseudovirus is more infectious than any other variant tested. Overall, this study highlights the importance of boosters to broaden neutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the VIC Innovation fund, the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogenesis Readiness, the German Center for Infection Research, the Peter and Ann Lambertus Family Foundation, the Medscape Young Investigators Lung Cancer Award, and the MGH Transformative Scholars Program.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of Massachusetts General Brigham gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, designated as a Variant of Concern(VOC) by the World Health Organization, carries numerous spike protein mutations which have been found to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. The susceptibility of Omicron variant by vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are urgently needed for risk assessment.Methods Omicron variant strains HKU691 and HKU344-R346K were isolated from patients using TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells. Whole genome sequence was determined using nanopore sequencing. Neutralization susceptibility of ancestral lineage A virus and the Omicron, Delta and Beta variants to sera from 25 BNT162b2 and 25 Coronavac vaccine recipients was determined using a live virus microneutralization assay.Results The Omicron variant strain HKU344-R346K has an additional spike R346K mutation, which is present in 8.5% of strains in GISAID database. Only 20% and 24% of BNT162b2 recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant HKU691 and HKU344-R346K, respectively, while none of the Coronavac recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody titer against either Omicron isolates. For BNT162b2 recipients, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titers(GMT) of the Omicron variant isolates(5.43 and 6.42) were 35.7-39.9-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus(229.4), and the GMT of both omicron isolates were significantly lower than those of the beta and delta variants. There was no significant difference in the GMT between HKU691 and HKU344-R346K.Conclusions Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by BNT162b2 or CoronaVac. The additional R346K mutation did not affect the neutralization susceptibility. Our data suggest that the Omicron variant may be associated with lower COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.Competing Interest StatementHC, KYY and KKWT report collaboration with Sinovac and Sinopharm.

%X BACKGROUND The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant has spread internationally and is responsible for rapidly increasing case numbers. The emergence of divergent variants in the context of a heterogeneous and evolving neutralizing antibody response in host populations might compromise protection afforded by vaccines or prior infection.METHODS We measured neutralizing antibody titers in 169 longitudinally collected plasma samples using pseudotypes bearing the Wuhan-hu-1 or the Omicron variant or a laboratory-designed neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 spike (PMS20). Plasmas were obtained from convalescents who did or did not subsequently receive an mRNA vaccine, or naive individuals who received 3-doses of mRNA or 1-dose Ad26 vaccines. Samples were collected approximately 1, 5-6 and 12 months after initial vaccination or infection.RESULTS Like PMS20, the Omicron spike protein was substantially resistant to neutralization compared to Wuhan-hu-1. In convalescent plasma the median deficit in neutralizing activity against PMS20 or Omicron was 30- to 60-fold. Plasmas from recipients of 2 mRNA vaccine doses were 30- to 180- fold less potent against PMS20 and Omicron than Wuhan-hu-1. Notably, previously infected or two-mRNA dose vaccinated individuals who received additional mRNA vaccine dose(s) had 38 to 154-fold and 35 to 214-fold increases in neutralizing activity against Omicron and PMS20 respectively.CONCLUSIONS Omicron exhibits similar distribution of sequence changes and neutralization resistance as does a laboratory-designed neutralization-resistant spike protein, suggesting natural evolutionary pressure to evade the human antibody response. Currently available mRNA vaccine boosters, that may promote antibody affinity maturation, significantly ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers.Competing Interest StatementPDB has received remuneration from Pfizer for consulting servicesFunding StatementThis work was supported by NIH grant R37AI64003 and R01AI501111 (P.D.B).; R01AI78788 (TH); P01AI138398S1 (M.C.N.) and 2U19AI111825 (M.C.N.).

%X Due to numerous mutations in the spike protein, the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Omicron (B.1.1.529) raises serious concerns since it may significantly limit the antibody-mediated neutralization and increase the risk of reinfections. While a rapid increase in the number of cases is being reported worldwide, until now there has been uncertainty about the efficacy of vaccinations and monoclonal antibodies. Our in vitro findings using authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants indicate that in contrast to the currently circulating Delta variant, the neutralization efficacy of vaccine-elicited sera against Omicron was severely reduced highlighting T-cell mediated immunity as essential barrier to prevent severe COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 Omicron was resistant to casirivimab and imdevimab, genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 may be needed before initiating mAb treatment. Variant-specific vaccines and mAb agents may be required to treat COVID-19 due to Omicron and other emerging variants of concern.Competing Interest StatementS.C. was a member of a clinical advisory board for Biontech.

%T Evaluating the number of unvaccinated people needed to exclude to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmissions

%X Background Vaccine mandates and vaccine passports (VMVP) for SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be a path out of the pandemic by increasing vaccination through coercion and excluding unvaccinated people from different settings because they are viewed as being at significant risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. While variants and waning efficacy are relevant, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines reduce the risk of infection, transmission, and severe illness/hospitalization in adults. Thus, higher vaccination levels are beneficial by reducing healthcare system pressures and societal fear. However, the benefits of excluding unvaccinated people are unknown.Methods A method to evaluate the benefits of excluding unvaccinated people to reduce transmissions is described, called the number needed to exclude (NNE). The NNE is analogous to the number needed to treat (NNT=1/ARR), except the absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the baseline transmission risk in the population for a setting (e.g., healthcare). The rationale for the NNE is that exclusion removes all unvaccinated people from a setting, such that the ARR is the baseline transmission risk for that type of setting, which depends on the secondary attack rate (SAR) typically observed in that type of setting and the baseline infection risk in the population. The NNE is the number of unvaccinated people who need to be excluded from a setting to prevent one transmission event from unvaccinated people in that type of setting. The NNE accounts for the transmissibility of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant to estimate the minimum NNE in six types of settings: households, social gatherings, casual close contacts, work/study places, healthcare, and travel/transportation. The NNE can account for future potentially dominant variants (e.g., Omicron, B.1.1.529). To assist societies and policymakers in their decision-making about VMVP, the NNEs were calculated using the current (mid-to-end November 2021) baseline infection risk in many countries.Findings The NNEs suggest that at least 1,000 unvaccinated people likely need to be excluded to prevent one SARS-CoV-2 transmission event in most types of settings for many jurisdictions, notably Australia, California, Canada, China, France, Israel, and others. The NNEs of almost every jurisdiction examined are well within the range of the NNTs of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (≥ 250 to 333). This is important since ASA is not recommended for primary prevention of CVD because the harms outweigh the benefits. Similarly, the harms of exclusion may outweigh the benefits. These findings depend on the accuracy of the model assumptions and the baseline infection risk estimates.Conclusions Vaccines are beneficial, but the high NNEs suggest that excluding unvaccinated people has negligible benefits for reducing transmissions in many jurisdictions across the globe. This is because unvaccinated people are likely not at significant risk – in absolute terms – of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to others in most types of settings since current baseline transmission risks are negligible. Consideration of the harms of exclusion is urgently needed, including staffing shortages from losing unvaccinated healthcare workers, unemployment/unemployability, financial hardship for unvaccinated people, and the creation of a class of citizens who are not allowed to fully participate in many areas of society.Registration CRD42021292263Funding This study received no grant from any funding agency, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

%X Schools were closed extensively in 2020-2021 to counter COVID-19 spread, impacting students’ education and well-being. With highly contagious variants expanding in Europe, safe options to maintain schools open are urgently needed. We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in school. We used empirical contact data in a primary and a secondary school, and data from pilot screenings in 683 schools during the 2021 spring Alpha wave in France. We fitted the model to observed school prevalence to estimate the school-specific reproductive number and performed a cost-benefit analysis examining different intervention protocols. We estimated RAlpha=1.40 (95%CI 1.35-1.45) in the primary and RAlpha=1.46 (1.41-1.51) in the secondary school during the wave, higher than Rt estimated from community surveillance. Considering the Delta variant and vaccination coverage in Europe, we estimated RDelta=1.66 (1.60-1.71) and RDelta=1.10 (1.06-1.14) in the two settings, respectively. Under these conditions, weekly screening with 75% adherence would reduce cases by 34% (95%CI 32-36%) in the primary and 36% (35-39%) in the secondary school compared to symptom-based testing. Insufficient adherence was recorded in pilot screening (median ≤53%). Regular screening would also reduce student-days lost up to 80% compared to reactive closure. Moderate vaccination coverage in students would still benefit from regular screening for additional control (23% case reduction with 50% vaccinated children). COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue to pose a risk for school opening. Extending vaccination coverage in students, complemented by regular testing largely incentivizing adherence, are essential steps to keep schools open, especially under the threat of more contagious variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was partially funded by: ANR projects COSCREEN (ANR-21-CO16-0005) and DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03); ANRS project EMERGEN (ANRS0151); EU H2020 grants MOOD (H2020-874850) and RECOVER (H2020-101003589); EU HORIZON grant VERDI; REACTing COVID-19 grant.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Contact studies were approved by the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL, the French national body responsible for ethics and privacy) and school authorities.

%X Pregnancy confers unique immune responses to infection and vaccination across gestation. To date, there is limited data comparing vaccine versus infection-induced nAb to COVID-19 variants in mothers during pregnancy. We analyzed paired maternal and cord plasma samples from 60 pregnant individuals. Thirty women vaccinated with mRNA vaccines were matched with 30 naturally infected women by gestational age of exposure. Neutralization activity against the five SARS-CoV-2 Spike sequences was measured by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped Spike virion assay. Effective nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 were present in maternal and cord plasma after both infection and vaccination. Compared to wild type or Alpha variant Spike, these nAbs were less effective against the Kappa, Delta, and Mu Spike variants. Vaccination during the third trimester induced higher nAb levels at delivery than infection during the third trimester. In contrast, vaccine-induced nAb levels were lower at the time of delivery compared to infection during the first trimester. The transfer ratio (cord nAb level/maternal nAb level) was greatest in mothers vaccinated in the second trimester. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection in pregnancy elicit effective nAbs with differing neutralization kinetics that is impacted by gestational time of exposure. Vaccine induced neutralizing activity was reduced against the Delta, Mu, and Kappa variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThese studies were supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Marino Family Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (NIAID K23AI127886 and NIAID K08AI141728), the Krzyzewski Family, UCSF National Center of Excellence in Women's Health, the Roddenberry Foundation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation, the Valley Medical Center Foundation and individual donors that provided support through our crowdfunding sites https://givingtogether.ucsf.edu/fundraiser/2718761 and https://spark.ucla.edu/project/20775.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the institutional review board of the UCSF (IRB# 20-32077), Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (IRB# 20-021), Oregon Health and Sciences University (IRB# STUDY00021569) and Marshall University (IRB# 1662248-1).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Objectives To provide data on the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines in people living with HIV (PWH), MVC-COV1901, a recombinant protein vaccine containing S-2P protein adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminium hydroxide, was assessed.Methods A total of 57 PWH of ≥ 20 years of age who are on stable antiretroviral therapy and with CD4+ T cell ≥ 350 cells/mm3 and HIV viral load &lt; 103 copies/ml were compared with 882 HIV-negative participants. Participants received 2 doses of MVC-COV1901 28 days apart. Safety and the immunogenicity were evaluated.Results No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded. Seroconversion rates (SCRs) of 100% and 99.8% were achieved in people living with HIV (PWH) and comparators, respectively, 28 days after second dose. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) against wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus were 136.62 IU/mL (WHO Standardized International Unit) (95% CI 114.3-163.3) and 440.41 IU/mL (95% CI 421.3-460.4), for PWH and control groups, respectively, after adjusting for sex, age, BMI category, and comorbidity, and the adjusted GMT ratio of comparator/PWH was 3.22 (95% CI 2.6-4.1). A higher CD4/CD8 ratio was associated with a higher GMT (R=0.27, p=0.039).Conclusions MVC-COV1901 has shown robust safety but weaker immunogenicity responses in PWH. As a result, a third dose or booster doses of MVC-COV1901 may be appropriate for PWH.Competing Interest StatementChia En Lien, Josue Antonio Garcia Estrada and I-Chen Tai are employees of Medigen Vaccine Biologics (Taipei, Taiwan) and they received grants from Taiwan Centres for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, during the conduct of the study.

%X COVID-19 has spread worldwide for nearly two years. Many countries have experienced repeated epidemics, that is, after the epidemic has been controlled for a period of time, the number of new cases per day is low, and the outbreak will occur again a few months later. In order to study the relationship between this low level of infection and the number of asymptomatic infections, and to evaluate the role of asymptomatic infections in the development of the epidemic, we have established an improved infectious disease dynamics model that can be used to evaluate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, and fitted the epidemic data in the three flat periods in England. According to the obtained parameters, according to the calculation of the model, the proportion of asymptomatic infections in these three flat periods are 41%, 53% and 58% respectively. After the first flat period, the number of daily newly confirmed cases predicted by the model began to increase around July 1, 2020. After more than four months of epidemic spread, it reached a peak on November 12, which is consistent with the actual case situation. Unanimous. After the second flat period, the model predicts that the number of new confirmed cases per day will increase from about May 7, 2021, and after about 73 days of epidemic development, it will reach a peak on July 20, showing the overall trend of the epidemic. In the above, the predicted results of the model are consistent with the actual cases. After the third flat period, the number of daily newly diagnosed cases predicted by the model began to increase around December 1, 2021, and reached a peak in December, and the number of cases will drop to a very low level after May 2022. According to our research results, due to the large number of asymptomatic infections, the spread of the epidemic is not easy to stop completely in a short time. However, when the epidemic enters a period of flat time, nucleic acid testing is performed, and asymptomatic infections are isolated at home for 14 days (the recovery period of symptomatic infection is about 10 days) may be an option that can be considered to interrupt the transmission of the case.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 11871093), Postgraduate Teaching Research and Quality Improvement Project of BUCEA (J2021010), BUCEA Post Graduate Innovation Project (2021098, 2021099).We thank all the individuals who generously shared their time and materials for this study.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

%X Importance SARS-CoV-2 enters the nasopharynx to replicate; nasal irrigation soon after diagnosis could reduce viral load and inhibit furin cleavage necessary for cell entry, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.Objective To determine whether initiating nasal irrigation after COVID-19 diagnosis reduces hospitalizations and death in high-risk outpatients, and whether irrigant composition impacts severity.Design Unblinded randomized clinical trial of two nasal irrigation protocols in older outpatients PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, with an observational arm using laboratory-confirmed cases in the CDC COVID-19 Case Surveillance dataset.Setting Single-lab community testing facility associated with the emergency department (ED) in Augusta, GA.Participants A consecutive sample of high-risk adults were enrolled within 24 hours of a positive COVID-19 test between September 24 and December 21 of 2020. Patients aged 55 and older were remotely consented. Among 826 screened, 321 of 694 eligible patients were unable to be reached, 294 refused participation, and 79 participants were enrolled.Interventions Participants were randomly assigned adding 2.5 mL povidone-iodine 10% or 2.5 mL sodium bicarbonate to 240 mL of isotonic nasal irrigation twice daily for 14 days.Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was hospitalization or death from COVID-19 within 28 days of enrollment by daily self-report confirmed with phone calls and hospital records, compared to the CDC Surveillance Dataset covering the same time. Secondary outcomes compared symptom resolution by irrigant additive.Results Seventy-nine high-risk participants were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 64 [8] years; 36 [46%] women; 71% Non-Hispanic White), with mean BMI 30.3. Analyzed by intention-to-treat, by day 28, COVID-19 symptoms resulted in one ED visit and no hospitalizations in 42 irrigating with alkalinization, one hospitalization of 37 in the povidone-iodine group, (1.27%) and no deaths. Of nearly three million CDC cases, 9.47% were known to be hospitalized, with an additional 1.5% mortality in those without hospitalization data. The total risk of hospitalization or death (11%) was 8.57 times that of enrolled patients (SE=2.74; P=.006). 62 completed daily surveys (78%), averaging 1.8 irrigations/day. Eleven had irrigation complaints, and four discontinued. There were no significant differences by additive.Conclusion SARS-CoV-2+ participants initiating nasal irrigation were over 8 times less likely to be hospitalized than the national rate.Trial Registration ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT04559035Author Approval All authors have filled out ICMJE and approved submission.Conflict of Interest Statement Materials were provided by Neilmed Inc. and Rhinosystems Inc. The study was supported by funding from the Bernard and Anne Gray Donor Advised Fund Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, Neilmed Inc., and Rhinosystems. No authors have conflict of interest.Question After testing positive for COVID-19, will rapidly initiating nasal irrigation reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality compared to a national dataset?Findings A consecutive sample of 79 high-risk adults (mean age 64, BMI 30.3) were randomized to initiate one of two nasal irrigation protocols within 24 hours of a positive COVID-19 test. Compared to a CDC COVID-19 National Dataset observational arm, 1.27% of participants initiating twice daily nasal irrigation were hospitalized or died, compared to 11%, a significant difference.Meaning In high-risk outpatients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 who initiated nasal irrigation rapidly after diagnosis, risk of hospitalization or death was eight times lower than national rates reported by the CDC.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04559035Funding StatementMaterials were provided by Neilmed Inc. and Rhinosystems Inc.

%X Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 evolution in specific geographies may help predict the properties of variants coming from these regions. We mapped neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain that evolved over 6 months from the ancestral virus in a person with advanced HIV disease. Infection was before the emergence of the Beta variant first identified in South Africa, and the Delta variant. We compared early and late evolved virus to the ancestral, Beta, Alpha, and Delta viruses and tested against convalescent plasma from ancestral, Beta, and Delta infections. Early virus was similar to ancestral, whereas late virus was similar to Beta, exhibiting vaccine escape and, despite pre-dating Delta, strong escape of Delta-elicited neutralization. This example is consistent with the notion that variants arising in immune-compromised hosts, including those with advanced HIV disease, may evolve immune escape of vaccines and enhanced escape of Delta immunity, with implications for vaccine breakthrough and reinfections.HighlightsA prolonged ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection pre-dating the emergence of Beta and Delta resulted in evolution of a Beta-like serological phenotypeSerological phenotype includes strong escape from Delta infection elicited immunity, intermediate escape from ancestral virus immunity, and weak escape from Beta immunityEvolved virus showed substantial but incomplete escape from antibodies elicited by BNT162b2 vaccinationCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates award INV-018944 (AS), National Institutes of Health award R01 AI138546 (AS), South African Medical Research Council awards (AS, TdO, PLM) and National Institutes of Health U01 AI151698 (WVV).

%X As global vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 proceed, there is particular interest in the longevity of immune protection, especially with regard to increasingly infectious virus variants. Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 are promising correlates of protective immunity and have been successfully used for prevention and therapy. As SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) are known to affect binding to the ACE2 receptor and by extension neutralizing activity, we developed a bead-based multiplex ACE2-RBD inhibition assay (RBDCoV-ACE2) as a highly scalable, time-, cost-, and material-saving alternative to infectious live-virus neutralization tests. By mimicking the interaction between ACE2 and the RBD, this serological multiplex assay allows the simultaneous analysis of ACE2 binding inhibition to the RBDs of all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and variants of interest (VOIs) in a single well. Following validation against a classical virus neutralization test and comparison of performance against a commercially available assay, we analyzed 266 serum samples from 168 COVID-19 patients of varying severity. ACE2 binding inhibition was reduced for ten out of eleven variants examined compared to wild-type, especially for those displaying the E484K mutation such as VOCs beta and gamma. ACE2 binding inhibition, while highly individualistic, positively correlated with IgG levels. ACE2 binding inhibition also correlated with disease severity up to WHO grade 7, after which it reduced.Competing Interest StatementNSM was a speaker at Luminex user meetings in the past.

%X Global healthcare systems continue to be challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is a need for clinical assays that can both help to optimize resource allocation and accelerate the development and evaluation of new therapies. Here, we present a multiplex proteomic panel assay for the assessment of disease severity and outcome prediction in COVID-19. The assay quantifies 50 peptides derived from 30 COVID-19 severity markers in a single measurement using analytical flow rate liquid chromatography and multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM), on equipment that is broadly available in routine and regulated analytical laboratories. We demonstrate accurate classification of COVID-19 severity in patients from two cohorts. Furthermore, the assay outperforms established risk assessments such as SOFA and APACHE II in predicting survival in a longitudinal COVID-19 cohort. The prognostic value implies its use for support of clinical decisions in settings with overstrained healthcare resources e.g. to optimally allocate resources to severely ill individuals with high chance of survival. It can furthermore be helpful for monitoring of novel therapies in clinical trials.Competing Interest StatementEM Scientific Limited (t/a Inoviv) and Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin filed joint patent applications for the protein panel assay described herein - United States Application No: 63/156291 and 63/283787.

%X The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a severe healthcare problem worldwide since the first outbreak in late December 2019. Currently, the COVID-19 vaccine has been used in many countries, but it is still unable to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection despite patients receiving full vaccination doses. Therefore, we aimed to appraise the booster effect of the different platforms of vaccines, including inactivated vaccine (BBIBP), viral vector vaccine (AZD122), and mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) in healthy adults who received the full dose of inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac). The booster dose was safe with no serious adverse events. Moreover, the immunogenicity indicated that the booster dose with viral vector and mRNA vaccine achieved a significant proportion of Ig anti-receptor binding domain (RBD), IgG anti-RBD, and IgA anti-S1 booster response. In contrast, inactivated vaccine achieved a lower booster response than others. Consequently, the neutralization activity of vaccinated serum had a high inhibition of over 90% against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and their variants (B.1.1.7–alpha, B.1.351–beta, and B.1.617.2–delta). In addition, IgG anti-nucleocapsid was observed only among the group that received the BBIBP booster. Our study found a significant increase in levels of interferon gamma-secreting T-cell response after the additional viral vector or mRNA booster vaccination. This study showed that administration with either viral vector (AZD1222) or mRNA (BNT162b2) boosters in individuals with a history of two doses of inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac) obtained great immunogenicity with acceptable adverse events.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR 20210910002)Funding StatementThis research was financially supported by Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI), National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Chulalongkorn University, and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital and partially supported by the Second Century Fund (C2F) to S.K., Chulalongkorn University.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (IRB number 546/64), and this trial has been registered with the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR 20210910002).

%X Background As evidence shows that vaccine immunity to COVID-19 wanes with time and decreases due to variants, several countries are implementing booster vaccination campaigns. The objective of this study was to analyze the morbidity and mortality burdens of different primary and booster vaccination strategies against COVID-19, using France as a case study.Methods We used a deterministic, age-structured, compartmental model fitted to hospital admission data and validated against sero-prevalence data in France to analyze the impact of primary and booster vaccination strategies on morbidity and mortality assuming waning of immunity and increased virus transmissibility during winter.Findings Strategies prioritizing primary vaccinations were systematically more effective than strategies prioritizing boosters. Regarding booster strategies targeting different age groups, their effectiveness varied with the levels of virus transmissibility, and according to the assumed loss of immunity for each age group. If the immunity reduction affects all age groups, people aged 30 to 49 years should be boosted in priority, even for low transmissibility levels. If the immunity reduction is restricted to people older than 65 years, boosting younger people becomes effective only above certain levels of transmissibility.Interpretation Increasing the primary vaccination coverage should remain a priority to reduce morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. If a plateau of primary vaccination has been reached, boosting immunity in younger age-groups could prevent more hospitalizations and deaths than boosting the immunity of older people, especially under conditions increasing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, or when facing new variants.Funding The study was partially funded by the French national research agency through project SPHINX-17-CE36-0008-0.Evidence before this study Many countries have started booster vaccination programs against Covid-19, while others are still struggling to vaccinate their population. However, evidence is scarce regarding the optimal vaccination strategy to pursue in a rapidly evolving epidemiological context. A search of the literature on Nov 27 2021, using the terms (booster OR third dose) AND vaccine AND strategy AND (COVID* OR SARS*) AND (effect OR impact), returned 45 studies on PubMed and 1602 on medRxiv. However, very few studies assessed the public health impact of a booster strategy, and none of them compared different allocations strategies between primary and booster vaccinations, or investigated which age-group should be targeted for booster vaccination to maximize the public health impact of the strategy.Added value of this study Using an epidemiological model able to replicate the dynamic of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and able to account for the use of multiple vaccines and booster, we analyzed the effectiveness of different vaccination strategies, either based on prioritization of primary vaccination versus booster, or based on the age-group targeted for the booster vaccination. We evaluated the strategies in terms of hospitalizations and deaths avoided, in various epidemic scenarios during winter 2021-2022. To our knowledge, this is the first modeling study evaluating such strategies. We found that increasing primary vaccination of all adults is always more beneficial than giving a booster dose to elderly individuals, and that the age-group to target for a booster dose for optimal effectiveness depends on the level of transmission of the virus. As the level of SARS-CoV-2 transmission increases, boosting immunity in younger age-groups becomes the most effective strategy to decrease hospitalizations and deaths in the general population.Implications of all available evidence Countries that have not reached the plateau of primary vaccination should focus their effort towards extending the overall primary vaccination coverage rather than boosting the immunity of fully vaccinated people, even for elderly individuals that may be facing waning immunity. When considering booster vaccination, the choice of which age groups to target should consider the level of virus transmissibility in the population. Considering the emergence of new, more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, increasing the worldwide vaccination coverage should remain a priority.Competing Interest StatementPC has received consulting fees from Sanofi-Pasteur for projects unrelated to COVID-19 and unrelated to this project.
